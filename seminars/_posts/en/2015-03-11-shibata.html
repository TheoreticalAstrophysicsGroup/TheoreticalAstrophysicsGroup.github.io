<p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are the one of the most energetic phenomena in the universe, with typically 10<sup>51</sup> erg in gamma rays emitted within of order few tens of seconds. In the case long gamma-ray burst, the radiation is emitted from relativistic jets launched as a result of the gravitational collapse of massive stars. But evn 40 years since the first discovery of GRB, the radiation mechanism has not been fully explained. The thermal radiation from relativistic jets has received most attention, but to to make quantitative progress, we require numerical simulation. In this seminar, I will present results from radiation transport calculations of the thermal radiation from the relativistic jet, whose structure is based on output from fluid-dynamical simulation.</p>
