<p>Dwarf galaxies are an important piece of the framework of hierarchical structure formation, being the building blocks for the formation of massive galaxies, and possibly one of the first objects to form. Dwarf galaxies therefore deserve attention as harboring important clues for the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Furthermore, dwarf galaxies are dark-matter dominated and are, thus, important objects for the study of the nature of dark matter. In particular, the density distribution of the dark matter is a particularly problematic because the observed structure differs markedly from the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm. In this talk, I present an analysis on the dynamics of dwarf galaxies and will discuss further issues that arise as a result. I will also present the future prospects of studying dwarf galaxies with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) and the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS).<p/>
