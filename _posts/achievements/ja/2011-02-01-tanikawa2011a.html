abstract: Using highly accurate N-body simulations, we explore the evolution of multiple
  massive black holes (hereafter MBHs) in a primordial galaxy that is composed of
  stars and MBHs. The evolution is pursed with a fourth-order Hermite scheme, where
  not only three-body interaction of MBHs but also dynamical friction by stars are
  incorporated. Initially, 10 MBHs with equal masses of 107 M sun are set in a host
  galaxy with 1011 M sun. It is found that 4-6 MBHs merge successively within 1 Gyr,
  emitting gravitational wave radiation. The key process for the successive merger
  of MBHs is the dynamical friction by field stars, which enhances three-body interactions
  of MBHs when they enter the central regions of the galaxy. The heaviest MBH always
  composes a close binary at the galactic center, which shrinks owing to the angular
  momentum transfer by the third MBH and eventually merges. The angular momentum transfer
  by the third MBH is due to the sling-shot mechanism. We find that the secular Kozai
  mechanism does not work for a binary to merge if we include the relativistic pericenter
  shift. The simulations show that a multiple MBH system can produce a heavier MBH
  at the galactic center purely through N-body process. This merger path can be of
  great significance for the growth of MBHs in a primordial galaxy. The merger of
  multiple MBHs may be a potential source of gravitational waves for the Laser Interferometer
  Space Antenna and pulsar timing.
