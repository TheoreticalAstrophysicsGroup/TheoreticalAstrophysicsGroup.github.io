本年度，当グループスタッフは， FIRSTプロジェクトを推し進めると共に，これを用いた宇宙第一世代天体および銀河形成の研究を行った。また，宇宙の電離史と銀河形成，銀河進化，銀河中心核，並びに星・惑星系形成の研究を展開した。 FIRSTプロジェクト （１）概要 文部科学省科学研究費補助金 特別推進研究「融合型並列計算機による宇宙第一世代天体の起源の解明」（平成16年度〜平成19年度，代表　梅村雅之）に基づき，宇宙第一世代天体形成に関する大規模なシミュレーションを実行するプロジェクト（FIRSTプロジェクト）を推進した。 （２）宇宙シミュレータ FIRST 宇宙第一世代天体の形成過程について大規模な輻射流体力学シミュレーションを行うためには， 物質と光の作用および重力相互作用を極めて高速に計算する必要がある。 目的とするシミュレーションのためには，物質・光の計算性能が数Tflops， 重力計算性能が数10Tflopsの計算機を必要とする。 我々は，これを実現するために，PCクラスタに新規開発したサーバ組み込み型の 重力計算専用ボードBlade-GRAPEを埋め込んだ宇宙シミュレータFIRST を完成させた。 FIRSTは，256の計算ノード，2つの管理ノード，2つのファイルサーバ， およびGfarmファイルシステムからなる。 計算ノードのうち，16ノードは32ビット型Blade-GRAPEを有し， 224ノードは64ビット型Blade-GRAPE X64 を有する。 ファイルサーバは2台で合計4.5TBの容量をもつ。 Gfarmファイルシステムは，ネットワーク共有ファイルシステムであり， 分散したローカルディスクから一つの共有ファイルシステムをつくる機構である。 これにより，総計22TBの共有ファイルシステムが構築されている。 FIRSTの総演算性能は，36.1TFLOPSであり，内ホスト部分3.1TFLOPS， Blade-GRAPE部分33TFLOPSである。また，主記憶容量は総計1.6TBである。 （３）FIRSTによる第一世代天体形成シミュレーション 第一世代天体の中で，最初の大質量星が誕生すると，大量の紫外線光を放射するため， その後の星形成に大きな影響を及ぼす。我々は，その影響を詳しく調べるために， FIRSTを用いて，紫外線光の輻射輸送と水素分子形成を無矛盾に扱った 3次元輻射流体力学計算を行った。 その結果，紫外線光の影響は，照射する密度ゆらぎのピークの高さに応じて， 次の２つの場合に分かれることがわかった。 (1) ピーク密度が閾値（10^2 cm^{-3} at 30pc）よりも高い場合， 紫外線光によってできた電離波面の前方に水素分子のシェルができることで， 水素分子解離光子が遮蔽され，重力コラプスを起こすことができる。 (2) ピーク密度が閾値よりも低い場合，電離波面前方に形成された衝撃波が， 中心のコラプス前に密度ゆらぎ全体に伝播し，その結果密度ゆらぎは蒸発する。 この結果を，第一世代天体の中での密度ゆらぎの平均的な高さと考え合わせると， 第一世代天体の大部分の領域で(1)の過程が起こり，最初の星の影響を受けずに， 星形成が可能であることがわかった。さらに，宇宙論的な構造形成シミュレーションを 第一世代天体ハローが数 100... </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="panel-footer"> <div

&nbsp;Taishi Nakamoto, &nbsp;Kohji Yoshikawa (Appointed March 1, 2007), &nbsp;Hiroyuki Hirashita, &nbsp;Kanako Sugimoto, &nbsp;Shigeaki Kato <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h"></i> </h4> <p> 研究活動概要 本年度，当グループスタッフは， FIRSTプロジェクトを推し進めると共に，これを用いた宇宙第一世代天体および銀河形成の研究を行った。また，宇宙の電離史と銀河形成，銀河進化，銀河中心核，並びに星・惑星系形成の研究を展開した。 FIRSTプロジェクト （１）概要 文部科学省科学研究費補助金 特別推進研究「融合型並列計算機による宇宙第一世代天体の起源の解明」（平成16年度〜平成19年度，代表　梅村雅之）に基づき，宇宙第一世代天体形成に関する大規模なシミュレーションを実行するプロジェクト（FIRSTプロジェクト）を推進した。 （２）宇宙シミュレータ FIRST 宇宙第一世代天体の形成過程について大規模な輻射流体力学シミュレーションを行うためには， 物質と光の作用および重力相互作用を極めて高速に計算する必要がある。 目的とするシミュレーションのためには，物質・光の計算性能が数Tflops， 重力計算性能が数10Tflopsの計算機を必要とする。 我々は，これを実現するために，PCクラスタに新規開発したサーバ組み込み型の 重力計算専用ボードBlade-GRAPEを埋め込んだ宇宙シミュレータFIRST を完成させた。 FIRSTは，256の計算ノード，2つの管理ノード，2つのファイルサーバ， およびGfarmファイルシステムからなる。 計算ノードのうち，16ノードは32ビット型Blade-GRAPEを有し， 224ノードは64ビット型Blade-GRAPE X64 を有する。 ファイルサーバは2台で合計4.5TBの容量をもつ。 Gfarmファイルシステムは，ネットワーク共有ファイルシステムであり， 分散したローカルディスクから一つの共有ファイルシステムをつくる機構である。 これにより，総計22TBの共有ファイルシステムが構築されている。 FIRSTの総演算性能は，36.1TFLOPSであり，内ホスト部分3.1TFLOPS， Blade-GRAPE部分33TFLOPSである。また，主記憶容量は総計1.6TBである。 （３）FIRSTによる第一世代天体形成シミュレーション 第一世代天体の中で，最初の大質量星が誕生すると，大量の紫外線光を放射するため， その後の星形成に大きな影響を及ぼす。我々は，その影響を詳しく調べるために， FIRSTを用いて，紫外線光の輻射輸送と水素分子形成を無矛盾に扱った 3次元輻射流体力学計算を行った。 その結果，紫外線光の影響は，照射する密度ゆらぎのピークの高さに応じて， 次の２つの場合に分かれることがわかった。 (1) ピーク密度が閾値（10^2 cm^{-3} at 30pc）よりも高い場合， 紫外線光によってできた電離波面の前方に水素分子のシェルができることで， 水素分子解離光子が遮蔽され，重力コラプスを起こすことができる。 (2) ピーク密度が閾値よりも低い場合，電離波面前方に形成された衝撃波が， 中心のコラプス前に密度ゆらぎ全体に伝播し，その結果密度ゆらぎは蒸発する。 この結果を，第一世代天体の中での密度ゆらぎの平均的な高さと考え合わせると， 第一世代天体の大部分の領域で(1)の過程が起こり，最初の星の影響を受けずに， 星形成が可能であることがわかった。さらに，宇宙論的な構造形成シミュレーションを 第一世代天体ハローが数 100... </p> <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> March 2007 &nbsp; <i
