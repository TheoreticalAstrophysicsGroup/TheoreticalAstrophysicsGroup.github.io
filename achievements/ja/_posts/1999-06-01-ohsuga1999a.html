abstract: We explore the radiation hydrodynamical evolution of a galactic nuclear
  gas disk exposed to intense radiation from circumnuclear starbursts. The evolution
  is characterized by two stages. First, the disk is radially contracted by the radiation
  force. Subsequently, the surface stratum of the disk avalanches onto the center
  due to the removal of angular momenta by radiation drag. The mass accretion via
  a radiatively-driven avalanche was analyzed quantitatively while assuming a torus
  shape of the circumnuclear starburst regions. As a result, it was found that the
  mass-accretion rate is sensitively dependent upon the extension of the starburst
  regions. For an optically thick disk, the mass-accretion rate is roughly in proportion
  to the ratio of the thickness to the curvature radius of the torus. The rate is
  also dependent upon the rotation law of the disk. We investigated the evolution
  of the disk surface density resulting from radiatively-driven mass accretion. It
  was found that for a more intensive starburst the central concentration of surface
  density becomes more conspicuous. The present results seem to be significant when
  considering the evolution of starburst nuclei, for instance, in luminous IRAS galaxies.
