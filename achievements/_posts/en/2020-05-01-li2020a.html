abstract: 'ART$^2$ is a 3D multiwavelength Monte Carlo radiative transfer (RT) code
  that couples continuum and emission lines to track the propagation of photons and
  their interactions with the interstellar medium (ISM). The original ART$^2$ has
  been extensively applied to hydrodynamics simulations to study panchromatic properties
  of galaxies and ISM. Here, we describe new implementations of non-local thermodynamic
  equilibrium RT of molecular and atomic fine structure emission lines, and the parallelization
  of the code using a number of novel methods. The new ART$^2$ can efficiently and
  self-consistently produce a full spectrum that includes both continuum and lines
  such as [C II], [N II], [O III], Ly \ensuremathα, and CO. These essential features,
  together with the multiphase ISM model and the adaptive grid, make ART$^2$ a multipurpose
  code to study multiwavelength properties of a wide range of astrophysical systems
  from planetary discs to large-scale structures. To demonstrate the capability of
  the new ART$^2$, we applied it to two hydrodynamics simulations: the zoom-in Milky
  Way Simulation to obtain panchromatic properties of individual galaxies, and the
  large-scale IllustrisTNG100 Simulation to obtain global properties such as the line
  intensity mappings. These products are vital for a broad array of studies. By enabling
  direct comparison between numerical simulations and multiband observations, ART$^2$
  provides a crucial theoretical framework for the understanding of existing and future
  surveys, and the synergy between multiband galaxy surveys and line intensity mappings.
  Therefore, ART$^2$ is a powerful and versatile tool to bridge the gap between theories
  and observations of cosmic structures.'
