abstract: We explore the gas dynamics near the dust sublimation radius of active galactic
  nucleus (AGN). For the purpose, we perform axisymmetric radiation hydrodynamic simulations
  of a dusty gas disc of radius \ensuremath≈1 pc around a supermassive black hole
  of mass 10$^7$ M$_☉$ taking into account (1) anisotropic radiation of accretion
  disc, (2) X-ray heating by corona, (3) radiative transfer of infrared (IR) photons
  re-emitted by dust, (4) frequency dependence of direct and IR radiations, and (5)
  separate temperatures for gas and dust. As a result, we find that for Eddington
  ratio \ensuremath≈0.77, a nearly neutral, dense (\\ensuremath≈ \ 10\̂6-8m̧\-̂3\),
  geometrically thin (h/r &lt; 0.06) disc forms with a high-velocity (\ensuremath≈200
  ̃ 3000 km s$^-1$) dusty outflow launched from the disc surface. The disc temperature
  is determined by the balance between X-ray heating and various cooling, and the
  disc is almost supported by thermal pressure. Contrary to Krolik (2007), the radiation
  pressure by IR photons is not effective to thicken the disc, but rather compresses
  it. Thus, it seems difficult for a radiation- supported, geometrically thick, obscuring
  torus to form near the dust sublimation radius as far as the Eddington ratio is
  high (̃1). The mass outflow rate is 0.05-0.1M_\☉\ yr\^1̂\ and the column density
  of the outflow is N$_H$ \ensuremathłesssim 10$^21$ cm$^-2$. To explain observed
  type-II AGN fraction, it is required that outflow gas is extended to larger radii
  (r \ensuremath\gtrsim 10 pc) or that a denser dusty wind is launched from smaller
  radii (r ̃ 10$^4$ R$_g$).
