abstract: 'We present a high-performance N-body code for self-gravitating collisional
  systems accelerated with the aid of a new SIMD instruction set extension of the
  x86 architecture: Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX), an enhanced version of the Streaming
  SIMD Extensions (SSE). With one processor core of Intel Core i7-2600 processor (8
  MB cache and 3.40 GHz) based on Sandy Bridge micro-architecture, we implemented
  a fourth-order Hermite scheme with individual timestep scheme ( Makino and Aarseth,
  1992), and achieved the performance of ̃20 giga floating point number operations
  per second (GFLOPS) for double-precision accuracy, which is two times and five times
  higher than that of the previously developed code implemented with the SSE instructions
  ( Nitadori et al., 2006b), and that of a code implemented without any explicit use
  of SIMD instructions with the same processor core, respectively. We have parallelized
  the code by using so-called NINJA scheme ( Nitadori et al., 2006a), and achieved
  ̃90 GFLOPS for a system containing more than N = 8192 particles with 8 MPI processes
  on four cores. We expect to achieve about 10 tera FLOPS (TFLOPS) for a self-gravitating
  collisional system with N ̃ 10 $^5$ on massively parallel systems with at most 800
  cores with Sandy Bridge micro- architecture. This performance will be comparable
  to that of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) cluster systems, such as the one with about
  200 Tesla C1070 GPUs ( Spurzem et al., 2010). This paper offers an alternative to
  collisional N-body simulations with GRAPEs and GPUs. <P />'
