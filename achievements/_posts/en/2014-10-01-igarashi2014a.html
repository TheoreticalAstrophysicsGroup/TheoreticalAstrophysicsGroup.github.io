abstract: 'We have classified possible transonic solutions of galactic outflows in
  the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo (DMH) and supermassive black
  hole (SMBH) under the assumptions of isothermal, spherically symmetric and steady
  state. It is clarified that the gravity of SMBH adds a new branch of transonic solutions
  with the transonic point in very close proximity to the centre in addition to the
  outer transonic point generated by the gravity of DMH. Because these two transonic
  solutions have substantially different mass fluxes and starting points, these solutions
  may have different influences on the evolution of galaxies and the release of metals
  into intergalactic space. We have applied our model to the Sombrero galaxy and obtained
  a new type of galactic outflow: a slowly accelerated transonic outflow through the
  transonic point at very distant region (≃126 kpc). In this galaxy, previous works
  reported that although the trace of the galactic outflow is observed by X-ray, the
  gas density distribution is consistent with the hydrostatic state. We have clarified
  that the slowly accelerating outflow has a gas density profile quite similar to
  that of the hydrostatic solution in the widely spread subsonic region. Thus, the
  slowly accelerating transonic solution cannot be distinguished from the hydrostatic
  solution in the observed region (\ensuremathłeq25 kpc) even if slow transonic flow
  exists. Our model provides a new perspective of galactic outflows and is applicable
  even to quiescent galaxies with inactive star formation.'
