abstract: 'Recent observations have successfully detected UV-bright and infrared-
  bright galaxies in the epoch of reionization. However, the origin of their radiative
  properties has not been understood yet. Combining cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
  and radiative transfer calculations, we present predictions of multiwavelength radiative
  properties of the first galaxies at z ̃ 6-15. Using zoom-in initial conditions,
  we investigate three massive galaxies and their satellites in different environment
  and halo masses at z = 6: M_h= 2.4× 10\̂10\ , 1.6× 10\1̂1\ , and 0.7× 10\^2̂\ \M_\☉
  \\. We find that most of the gas and dust are ejected from star-forming regions
  by supernova feedback, which allows the UV photons to escape. We show that the peak
  of the spectral energy distribution (SED) rapidly changes between UV and infrared
  wavelengths on a time-scale of ̃ 100 Myr due to intermittent star formation and
  feedback, and the escape fraction of UV photons fluctuates in the range of 0.2-0.8
  at z &lt; 10 with a time-averaged value of 0.3. When dusty gas covers the star-forming
  regions, the galaxies become bright in the observed-frame sub-millimeter wavelengths.
  We predict the detectability of high-z galaxies with the Atacama Large Millimeter
  Array (ALMA). For a sensitivity limit of 0.1 mJy at 850 \\ensuremathμ m\, the detection
  probability of galaxies in haloes M_h\ensuremath\gtrsim 10\^\\̂ \M_\☉ \\ at z \ensuremathłesssim
  7 exceeds fifty per cent. We argue that supernova feedback can produce the observed
  diversity of SEDs for high-z galaxies.'
