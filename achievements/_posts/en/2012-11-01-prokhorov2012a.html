abstract: High-resolution imaging of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect opens new
  possibilities for testing the presence of various high-energy particle populations
  in clusters of galaxies. A detailed X-ray analysis of the 'Bullet cluster' (1E 0657-56)
  with Chandra has revealed the presence of additional X-ray spectral components beyond
  a simple, single-temperature plasma in its X-ray spectra. X-ray methods alone are
  insufficient to elucidate the origins of these spectral components. We show that
  the morphology and magnitude of the SZ effect at high frequencies are critically
  dependent upon the mechanism by which the additional X-ray spectra are created.
  We examine the differences between the predicted SZ effect emission maps at 600
  GHz assuming the X-ray spectra are composed of thermal gas with a steep power-law
  index component and also thermal gas with a significant contribution of strongly
  heated gas. A two-temperature model with a hot (kT ≃ 30-40 keV) second component
  is the most consistent with existing SZ data at high frequencies. However, significant
  morphological differences remain. High-angular-resolution SZ intensity maps at high
  frequencies in combination with deep X-ray data provide a new window into understanding
  particle energization processes in the hottest, massive merging galaxy clusters.
