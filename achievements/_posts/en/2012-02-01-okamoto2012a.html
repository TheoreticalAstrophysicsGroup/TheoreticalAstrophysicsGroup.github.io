abstract: We present two types of numerical prescriptions that accelerate the radiative
  transfer calculation around point sources within a three-dimensional Cartesian grid
  by using the oct-tree structure for the distribution of radiation sources. In one
  prescription, distant radiation sources are grouped as a bright extended source
  when the group's angular size, \ensuremathþeta$_s$, is smaller than a critical value,
  \ensuremathþeta$_crit$, and radiative transfer is solved on supermeshes whose angular
  size is similar to that of the group of sources. The supermesh structure is constructed
  by coarse-graining the mesh structure. With this method, the computational time
  scales with N$_m$log (N$_m$)log (N$_s$), where N$_m$ and N$_s$ are the number of
  meshes and that of radiation sources, respectively. While this method is very efficient,
  it inevitably overestimates the optical depth when a group of sources acts as an
  extended powerful radiation source and affects distant meshes. In the other prescription,
  a distant group of sources is treated as a bright point source ignoring the spatial
  extent of the group, and the radiative transfer is solved on the meshes rather than
  the supermeshes. This prescription is simply a grid-based version of START by Hasegawa
  &amp; Umemura and yields better results in general with slightly more computational
  cost [?] than the supermesh prescription. Our methods can easily be implemented
  to any grid- based hydrodynamic codes and are well suited to adaptive mesh refinement
  methods.
