abstract: 'We study star cluster formation in various environments with different
  metallicities and column densities by performing a suite of 3D radiation hydrodynamics
  simulations. We find that the photoionization feedback from massive stars controls
  the star formation efficiency (SFE) in a star-forming cloud, and its impact sensitively
  depends on the gas metallicity Z and initial cloud surface density \ensuremathΣ.
  At Z = 1 Z$_☉$, SFE increases as a power law from 0.03 at \ensuremathΣ = 10 M$_☉
  $pc$^-2$ to 0.3 at $Σ = 300\,\mathrmM_ødot \, m̊ pc^-2$ . In low-metallicity cases
  $10^-2\!-\!10^-1\, \mathrmZ_ødot $ , star clusters form from atomic warm gases because
  the molecule formation time is not short enough with respect to the cooling or dynamical
  time. In addition, the whole cloud is disrupted more easily by expanding H II bubbles
  that have higher temperature owing to less efficient cooling. With smaller dust
  attenuation, the ionizing radiation feedback from nearby massive stars is stronger
  and terminate star formation in dense clumps. These effects result in inefficient
  star formation in low- metallicity environments: the SFE drops by a factor of \ensuremath∼3
  at Z = 10$^-2 $Z$_☉$ compared to the results for Z = 1 Z$_☉$, regardless of \ensuremathΣ.
  Newborn star clusters are also gravitationally less bound. We further develop a
  new semi-analytical model that can reproduce the simulation results well, particularly
  the observed dependencies of the SFEs on the cloud surface densities and metallicities.'
