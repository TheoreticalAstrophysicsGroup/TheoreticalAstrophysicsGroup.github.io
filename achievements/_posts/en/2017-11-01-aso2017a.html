abstract: We have recently observed the Class 0/I protostar L1527 IRS using the Atacama
  Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) during its Cycle 1 in 220 GHz dust continuum
  and C$^18$O (J=2-1) line emissions with a ̃2 times higher angular resolution (̃
  0\textbac kslashbuildrel\\prime\prime\\textbac kslashover\.\ 5) and ̃4 times better
  sensitivity than our ALMA Cycle 0 observations. Continuum emission shows elongation
  perpendicular to the associated outflow, with a deconvolved size of 0\buildrel\\prime\pri
  me\\over\.\ 53× 0\buildr el\\prime\prime\\over\ .\ 15. C$^18$O emission shows similar
  elongation, indicating that both emissions trace the disk and the flattened envelope
  surrounding the protostar. The velocity gradient of the C$^18$O emission along the
  elongation due to rotation of the disk/envelope system is reanalyzed, identifying
  Keplerian rotation proportional to \\\r\\\$^-0.5$ more clearly than the Cycle 0
  observations. The Keplerian-disk radius and the dynamical stellar mass are kinematically
  estimated to be ̃74 au and ̃ 0.45 \M\$_☉ $, respectively. The continuum visibility
  is fitted by models without any annulus averaging, revealing that the disk is in
  hydrostatic equilibrium. The best-fit model also suggests a density jump by a factor
  of ̃5 between the disk and the envelope, suggesting that disks around protostars
  can be geometrically distinguishable from the envelope from a viewpoint of density
  contrast. Importantly, the disk radius geometrically identified with the density
  jump is consistent with the kinematically estimated radius. Possible origin of the
  density jump due to the mass accretion from the envelope to the disk is discussed.
  C$^18$O observations can be reproduced by the same geometrical structures derived
  from the dust observations, with possible C$^18$O freeze-out and localized C$^18$O
  desorption.
