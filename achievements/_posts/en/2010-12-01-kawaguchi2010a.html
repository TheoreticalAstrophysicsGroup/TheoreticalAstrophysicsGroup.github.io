abstract: A sublimation process governs the innermost region of the dusty torus of
  active galactic nuclei. However, the observed inner radius of the torus is systematically
  smaller than the expected radius by a factor of åisebox-0.5ex~1/3. We show that
  the anisotropy of the emission from accretion disks resolves this conflict naturally
  and quantitatively. An accretion disk emits lesser radiation in the direction closer
  to its equatorial plane (i.e., to the torus). We find that the anisotropy makes
  the torus inner region closer to the central black hole and concave. Moreover, the
  innermost edge of the torus may connect with the outermost edge of the disk continuously.
  Considering the anisotropic emission of each clump in the torus, we calculate the
  near-infrared flux variation in response to a UV flash. For an observer at the polar
  angle \ensuremathþeta$_obs$ = 25°, the centroid of the time delay is found to be
  37% of the delay expected in the case of isotropic illumination, which explains
  the observed systematic deviation.
