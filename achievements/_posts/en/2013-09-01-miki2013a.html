abstract: We have developed a highly optimized code for collisionless N-body calculations
  based on direct summation. Our new optimization hides the global memory access latency,
  and the resulting CUDA code has a peak performance of 1006.7 GFlop/s in single precision
  (assuming 26 floating-point operations per interaction) with a single NVIDIA Tesla
  M2090 board. To improve the scalability of the OpenMP/MPI hybrid parallelized code,
  we have reduced the number of communications among multiple GPUs and have overlapped
  communications with computations to hide communication time. The code's performance
  was measured on the HA-PACS (Highly Accelerated Parallel Advanced system for Computational
  Sciences), a recently installed GPGPU cluster at University of Tsukuba. The results
  show excellent scalability with superlinear scaling when the number of N-body particles
  per GPU is less than 10$^4$ and parallel efficiency approaching unity when the number
  of N-body particles per GPU is greater than 10$^4$. The CUDA/OpenMP/MPI code has
  a peak performance of 255.5 TFlop/s when 256 NVIDIA Tesla M2090 boards are used,
  which is 75.0% of the theoretical peak performance. <P />
