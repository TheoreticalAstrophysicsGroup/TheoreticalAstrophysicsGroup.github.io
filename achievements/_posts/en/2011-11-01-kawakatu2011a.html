abstract: We propose a new method to explore the candidate super-Eddington active
  galactic nuclei (AGNs). We examine the properties of infrared (IR) emission from
  the inner edge of the dusty torus in AGNs, which are powered by super- or sub-Eddington
  accretion flows around black holes, by considering the dependence of the polar angle
  on the radiation flux of accretion flows. We find that for super-Eddington AGNs,
  of which the mass accretion rate is more than 10$^2$ times larger than the Eddington
  rate, the ratio of the AGN IR luminosity and the disc bolometric luminosity is less
  than 10$^-2$, unless the half opening angle of the torus (\ensuremathþeta$_torus$)
  is small (\ensuremathþeta$_torus$ &lt; 65°). This is due to the self-occultation
  effect, whereby the self-absorption at the outer region of the super-Eddington flow
  dilutes the illumination of the torus. Such a small luminosity ratio is not observed
  in sub-Eddington AGNs, whose mass accretion rate is comparable to or no more than
  10 times larger than the Eddington mass accretion rate, except for extremely thin
  tori (\ensuremathþeta$_torus$ &gt; 85°). We also consider the properties of the
  near-IR (NIR) emission radiated from hot dust &gt;1000 K. We find that super-Eddington
  AGNs have a ratio of the NIR luminosity to the bolometric luminosity, L$_NIR, AGN$/L$_bol,
  disc$, at least one order of magnitude smaller than for sub-Eddington AGNs for a
  wide range of half opening angle (\ensuremathþeta$_torus$ &gt; 65°), for various
  types of dusty torus model. Thus, a relatively low L$_NIR, AGN$/L$_bol, disc$ is
  a property that allows identification of candidate super-Eddington AGNs. Lastly,
  we discuss the possibility that NIR-faint quasars at redshift z̃ 6 discovered by
  a recent deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey may be young quasars whose black holes grow
  via super- Eddington accretion.
