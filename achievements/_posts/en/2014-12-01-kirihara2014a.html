abstract: The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology, which is the standard theory of the
  structure formation in the universe, predicts that the outer density profile of
  dark matter halos decreases with the cube of distance from the center. However,
  so far not much effort has been expended in examining this hypothesis. In the halo
  of the Andromeda galaxy (M 31), large-scale stellar structures detected by the recent
  observations provide a potentially suitable window to investigate the mass-density
  distribution of the dark matter halo. We explore the density structure of the dark
  matter halo in M 31 using an N-body simulation of the interaction between an accreting
  satellite galaxy and M 31. To reproduce the Andromeda Giant Southern Stream and
  the stellar shells at the east and west sides of M 31, we find the sufficient condition
  for the power-law index \ensuremathα of the outer density distribution of the dark
  matter halo. The best-fitting parameter is \ensuremathα = -3.7, which is steeper
  than the CDM prediction.
