abstract: 'Hot corino chemistry and warm carbon chain chemistry (WCCC) are driven
  by gas-grain interactions in star-forming cores: radical-radical recombination reactions
  to form complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ice mantle, sublimation of CH$_4$
  and COMs, and their subsequent gas-phase reactions. These chemical features are
  expected to depend on the composition of the ice mantle, which is set in the prestellar
  phase. We calculated the gas-grain chemical reaction network considering a layered
  ice mantle structure in star-forming cores to investigate how the hot corino chemistry
  and WCCC depend on the physical condition of the static phase before the onset of
  gravitational collapse. We found that WCCC becomes more active if the temperature
  is lower, or the visual extinction is lower in the static phase, or the static phase
  is longer. The dependence of hot corino chemistry on the static-phase condition
  is more complex. While CH$_3$OH is less abundant in the models with a warmer static
  phase, some COMs are formed efficiently in those warm models because there are various
  formation paths of COMs. If the visual extinction is lower, photolysis makes COMs
  less abundant in the static phase. Once the collapse starts and visual extinction
  increases, however, COMs can be formed efficiently. The duration of the static phase
  does not largely affect COM abundances. The chemical diversity between prototypical
  hot corinos and hybrid sources, in which both COMs and carbon chains are reasonably
  abundant, can be explained by the variation of prestellar conditions. Deficiency
  of gaseous COMs in prototypical WCCC sources is, however, hard to reproduce within
  our models.'
