<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >MeerKAT radio continuum and XMM-Newton X-ray images have recently revealed a
spectacular bipolar channel at the Galactic Center that spans several degrees (~0.5 kpc). An
intermittent jet likely formed this channel and is consistent with earlier evidence of a
sustained, Seyfert-level outburst fueled by black hole accretion onto Sgr A* several Myr ago.
Therefore, to trace a now weak jet that perhaps penetrated, deflected, and percolated along
multiple paths through the interstellar medium, relevant interactions are identified and
quantified in archival X-ray images, Hubble Space Telescope Paschen <span 
class="txmi-">α </span>images and Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array millimeter-wave spectra, and new SOAR telescope IR
spectra. Hydrodynamical simulations are used to show how a nuclear jet can explain
these structures and inflate the ROSAT/eROSITA X-ray and Fermi <span 
class="txmi-">γ</span>-ray bubbles
that extend 75<sup><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">∘</span></sup> from the Galactic plane. Thus, our Galactic outflow has features in
common with energetic, jet-driven structures in the prototypical Seyfert galaxy NGC
1068.</p>
