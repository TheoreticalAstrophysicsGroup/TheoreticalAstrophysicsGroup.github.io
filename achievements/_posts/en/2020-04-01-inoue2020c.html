abstract: We calculate the pulsed fraction (PF) of the super-critical column accretion
  flows on to magnetized neutron stars (NSs), of which the magnetic axis is misaligned
  with the rotation axis, based on the simulation results by Kawashima et al. (2016,
  PASJ, 68, 83). Here, we solve the geodesic equation for light in the Schwarzschild
  spacetime in order to take into account the light- bending effect. The gravitational
  redshift and the relativistic Doppler effect from gas motions of the accretion columns
  are also incorporated. The pulsed emission appears since the observed luminosity,
  which exceeds the Eddington luminosity for the stellar-mass black holes, periodically
  changes via precession of the column caused by the rotation of the NS. The PF tends
  to increase as $þeta _m̊ obs$ approaches to $þeta _\ ̊B$ , where $þeta _\ro̊bs$
  and $þeta _\rm̊$ are the observer's viewing angle and the polar angle of the magnetic
  axis measured from the rotation axis, respectively. The maximum PF is around 50%.
  Also, we find that the PF becomes less than 5% for $þeta _\rm s̊ łesssim 5^∘$ or
  for $þeta _\rm Bł̊esssim 5^∘$ . Our results are consistent with observations of
  ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) with few exceptions, since the ULXPs mostly
  exhibit the PF of $łesssim 50$ %. Our present study supports the hypothesis that
  the ULXPs are powered by the super-critical column accretion on to NSs.
