abstract: 'We present results of a survey for giant Ly\ensuremathα blobs (LABs) at
  z = 3 with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. We obtained Ly\ensuremathα imaging at z = 3.09 \ensuremath±
  0.03 around the SSA22 protocluster and in several blank fields. The total survey
  area is 2.1 deg$^2$, corresponding to a comoving volume of 1.6 × 10$^6$ Mpc$^3$.
  Using a uniform detection threshold of 1.4 × 10$^-18$ erg s$^-1$ cm$^-2$ arcsec$^-2$
  for the Ly\ensuremathα images, we construct a sample of 14 LAB candidates with major-
  axis diameters larger than 100 kpc, including five previously known blobs and two
  known quasars. This survey triples the number of known LABs over 100 kpc. The giant
  LAB sample shows a possible `morphology—density relation'': filamentary LABs reside
  in average density environments as derived from compact Ly\ensuremathα emitters,
  while circular LABs reside in both average density and overdense environments. Although
  it is hard to examine the formation mechanisms of LABs only from the Ly\ensuremathα
  morphologies, more filamentary LABs may relate to cold gas accretion from the surrounding
  intergalactic medium (IGM) and more circular LABs may relate to large-scale gas
  outflows, which are driven by intense starbursts and/or by active galactic nucleus
  activities. Our survey highlights the potential usefulness of giant LABs to investigate
  the interactions between galaxies and the surrounding IGM from the field to overdense
  environments at high redshift.'
