abstract: We consider recently reported ``downsizing'' of galaxies as well as SMBHs
  from a theoretical point of view. If the putative SMBH-to- bulge relation is incorporated,
  the downsizing of galaxies and SMBHs implies the downsizing of galactic bulges.
  We propose a physical mechanism to bring the downsizing of galactic bulges with
  the consideration of galaxy formation in UV background radiation. The star formation
  efficiency in primordial galaxies is basically regulated by the self-shielding againt
  UV background radiation. At higher redshift epochs, the selfshielding is stronger,
  and therefore galaxies form in a dissipationless fashion. As a result, earlier type
  (higher bulge-to-disk ratio) galaxies form at earlier epochs. Besides, a radiation-hydrodynamic
  mechanism is proposed to account for the SMBHto- bulge relation. The growth of SMBHs
  can be promoted through the mass accretion driven by radiation drag which is exerted
  on dusty interstellar gas in radiation fields generated by bulge stars. It turns
  out that the resultant mass of a SMBH is predicted to be in proportion to the bulge
  mass, and the mass ratio is basically determined by the nuclear energy conversion
  efficiency from hydrogen to helium, \ensuremathın=0.007. In this scenario, the bulge
  luminosity overwhelms the BH accretion luminosity in the growing phase of SMBH.
  This phase corresponds to a ``proto-QSOV'', thereafter evolving to a QSO. Also,
  the proto-QSO phase is preceded by an optically-thick ultraluminous infrared galaxy
  (ULIRG) phase. This provides a coevolution scheme of SMBHs and bulges. If coupled
  with the downsizing of bulges, this coevolution scheme leads to the downsizing of
  SMBHs. The present scenario is a potential solution of the coevolution and downsizing
  of SMBHs and galactic bulges. <P />
