abstract: We present a novel radiation hydrodynamics code, START, which is a smoothed
  particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme coupled with accelerated radiative transfer.
  The basic idea for the acceleration of radiative transfer is parallel to the tree
  algorithm that is hitherto used to speed up the gravitational force calculation
  in an N-body system. It is demonstrated that the radiative transfer calculations
  can be dramatically accelerated, where the computational time is scaled as N$_p$
  logN$_s$ for N$_p$ SPH particles and N$_s$ radiation sources. Such acceleration
  allows us to readily include not only numerous sources but also scattering photons,
  even if the total number of radiation sources is comparable to that of SPH particles.
  Here, a test simulation is presented for a multiple source problem, where the results
  with START are compared to those with a radiation SPH code without tree-based acceleration.
  We find that the results agree well with each other if we set the tolerance parameter
  as \ensuremathþeta$_crit$ &lt;= 1.0, and then it demonstrates that START can solve
  radiative transfer faster without reducing the accuracy. One of the important applications
  with START is to solve the transfer of diffuse ionizing photons, where each SPH
  particle is regarded as an emitter. To illustrate the competence of START, we simulate
  the shadowing effect by dense clumps around an ionizing source. As a result, it
  is found that the erosion of shadows by diffuse recombination photons can be solved.
  Such an effect is of great significance to reveal the cosmic reionization process.
