abstract: We present the results of cosmological simulations of large-scale structure
  formation with massive neutrinos. The phase-space distribution of the cosmic relic
  neutrinos is followed, for the first time, by directly integrating the six-dimensional
  Vlasov─Poisson equations. Our novel approach allows us to represent free streaming
  and clustering of neutrinos, and their gravitational interaction with cold dark
  matter accurately. We thus obtain solutions for the collisionless dynamics independent
  of conventional N-body methods. We perform a suite of hybrid N-body/Vlasov simulations
  with varying the neutrino mass, and systematically examine the dynamical effects
  of massive neutrinos on large-scale structure formation. Our simulations show characteristic
  large-scale clustering of the neutrinos and their coherent streaming motions relative
  to dark matter. The effective local neutrino ``temperature'' around massive galaxy
  clusters varies by several percent with respect to the cosmic mean; the neutrinos
  in clusters can be hotter or colder depending on the neutrino mass. We study a number
  of statistics of the large-scale structure and of dark matter halos in comparison
  with those obtained by N-body simulations and/or by perturbation theory. Our simulations
  mark an important milestone in numerical cosmology, and pave a new way to study
  cosmic structure formation with massive neutrinos.
