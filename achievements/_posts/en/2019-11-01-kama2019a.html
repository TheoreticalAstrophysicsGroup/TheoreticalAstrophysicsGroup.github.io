abstract: 'Sulfur is one of the most abundant elements in the universe, with important
  roles in astro-, geo-, and biochemistry. Its main reservoirs in planet-forming disks
  have previously eluded detection: gaseous molecules only account for &lt;1% of total
  elemental sulfur, with the rest likely in either ices or refractory minerals. We
  use a new method to measure the refractory component. Mechanisms such as giant planets
  can filter out dust from gas accreting onto disk-hosting stars. For stars above
  1.4 solar masses, this leaves a chemical signature on the stellar photosphere that
  can be used to determine the fraction of each element that is locked in dust. Here,
  we present an application of this method to sulfur, zinc, and sodium. We analyze
  the accretion-contaminated photospheres of a sample of young stars and find (89
  \ensuremath± 8)% of elemental sulfur is in refractory form in their disks. The main
  carrier is much more refractory than water ice, consistent with sulfide minerals
  such as FeS.'
