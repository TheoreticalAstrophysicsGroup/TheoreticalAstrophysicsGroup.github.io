<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Galactic winds are crucial to the cosmic cycle of matter, transporting material out of the
dense regions of galaxies. Observations show the coexistence of different temperature phases
in such winds, which is not easy to explain. We present a set of 3D shock- multicloud
simulations that account for radiative heating and cooling at temperatures between <span 
class="txr-">10</span><sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sup> and
<span 
class="txr-">10</span><sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">7</span></sup><span style="margin-left:0.3em" class="thinspace"></span><span 
class="txmi-">K</span>. The interplay between shock heating, dynamical instabilities, turbulence, and radiative
heating and cooling creates a complex multiphase flow with a rain-like morphology. Cloud
gas fragments and is continuously eroded, becoming efficiently mixed and mass loaded. The
resulting warm mixed gas then cools down and precipitates into new dense cloudlets, which
repeat the process. Thus, radiative cooling is able to sustain fast-moving dense gas by
aiding condensation of gas from warm clouds and the hot wind. In the ensuing
outflow, hot gas with temperatures <span 
class="txmi-">rsim</span><span 
class="txr-">10</span><sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">6</span></sup><span style="margin-left:0.3em" class="thinspace"></span><span 
class="txmi-">K </span>outruns the warm and cold phases,
which reach thermal equilibrium near <span 
class="txsy-">≈</span><span 
class="txr-">10</span><sup><span

class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sup><span style="margin-left:0.3em" class="thinspace"></span><span 
class="txmi-">K</span>, respectively. Although
the volume filling factor of hot gas is higher in the outflow, most of the mass is
concentrated in dense gas cloudlets and filaments with these temperatures. More
porous multicloud layers result in more vertically extended outflows, and dense
gas is more efficiently produced in more compact layers. The cold phase is not
accelerated by ram pressure, but, instead, precipitates from warm and mixed gas
out of thermal equilibrium. This cycle can explain the presence of high- velocity
