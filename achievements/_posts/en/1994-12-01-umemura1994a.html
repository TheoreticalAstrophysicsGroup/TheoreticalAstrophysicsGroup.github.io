abstract: The spherically symmetric gas accretion regulated by external radiation
  drag is investigated under the steady-state approximation. As for the gravitational
  force, the dark-matter/point mass potentials as well as the self-gravity are considered.
  The radiation drag force is proportional to the velocity vector v as -beta \mbox
  \v\\, where beta is a coefficient which is determined by the intensity of the radiation
  fields. We seek steady solutions under the assumption that beta is constant spatially
  and temporally. The analyses are separately made for a cold regime where the gas
  pressure is ignored and for a warm regime where the effects of pressure are included.
  In all of the cases considered, analytic steady solutions are found for spherical
  gas accretion with radiation drag. They include a modified solution for the Bondi
  accretion. Accretion via radiation drag may be a key process for the formation of
  condensed objects in the early universe shortly after cosmological recombination
  during which the radiation density of the Cosmic Background Radiation is sufficiently
  high. If the universe is dominated by dark matter, in the early stage of the evolution
  of high-density peaks, the gas would accrete in the dark-matter potential. In the
  later stage and/or in the central region, the self-gravity becomes important compared
  to the dark- matter potentials. If the central dense core evolves into a black hole,
  in the last stage and/or in the very center, the gas would accrete in the point-mass
  potential exerted by the black hole. The obtained solutions are applicable for each
  phase.
