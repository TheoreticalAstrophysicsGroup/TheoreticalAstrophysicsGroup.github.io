abstract: We report the first evidence of a hot corino in a Bok globule. This is based
  on ALMA observations in the 1.2 mm band toward the low- mass Class 0 protostar IRAS
  19347+0727 in B335. Saturated complex organic molecules (COMs), CH$_3$CHO, HCOOCH$_3$,
  and NH$_2$CHO, are detected in a compact region within a few 10 au around the protostar.
  Additionally, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$OH, C$_2$H$_5$CN, and CH$_3$COCH$_3$ are
  tentatively detected. Carbon-chain related molecules, CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$, are
  also found in this source, whose distributions are extended over a scale of a few
  100 au. On the other hand, sulfur-bearing molecules CS, SO, and SO$_2$ have both
  compact and extended components. Fractional abundances of the COMs relative to H$_2$
  are found to be comparable to those in known hot corino sources. Though the COMs
  lines are as broad as 5-8 km s$^-1$, they do not show obvious rotation motion in
  the present observation. Thus, the COMs mainly exist in a structure whose distribution
  is much smaller than the synthesized beam (0.″58 × 0.″52).
