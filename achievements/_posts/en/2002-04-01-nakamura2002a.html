abstract: In the context of star formation through fragmentation of an extremely metal
  deficient protogalactic cloud, the gravitational collapse of filamentary gas clouds
  is explored with one-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics coupled with nonequilibrium
  chemistry of H$_2$ and HD. It is found that the cloud evolution is governed mainly
  by the initial central density (n$_c,0$) and H$_2$ abundance (x$_H<SUB>2$,0</SUB>).
  In particular, the evolution of low-density filaments (n$_c,0$&lt;åisebox-0.5ex~10$^5$
  cm$^-3$) bifurcates at a threshold H$_2$ abundance of x$_H< SUB>2$,cr</SUB>\i̊sebox-0.5ex~=3×10
  $^-3$, beyond which HD cooling overwhelms H$_2$ cooling. The contraction of a filament
  with n$_c,0$&lt;\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~10$^5$ cm$^-3$ and x$_H<SUB>2$,0</SUB>&gt;\rae̊box-0.5ex\textas
  ciitildex$_H<SUB>2$,cr</SUB> is strongly decelerated when the central density (n$_c$)
  reaches a critical density of HD at which LTE level populations are achieved, and
  therefore the filament is expected to fragment at \raib̊ox-0.5ex~10$^7$ cm$^-3$.
  The fragment mass is lowered to be \raiso̊x-0.5ex~10 M$_solar$. In contrast, the
  contraction of a filament with n$_c,0$&lt;\raisex̊-0.5ex~10$^5$ cm$^-3$ and x$_H<SUB>2$,0</SUB>&lt;\raiseb̊-0.5ex\textas
  ciitildex$_H<SUB>2$,cr</SUB> is regulated by H$_2$ cooling. In this case, the filament
  tends to fragment at lower density as \raisebo-̊0.5ex~10$^4$ cm$^-3$ owing to the
  low critical density of H$_2$, and the fragment mass is as high as \raisebox0̊.5ex~10$^2$
  M$_solar$. For a high-density filament with n$_c,0$&gt;\raisebox.̊5ex~10$^5$ cm$^-3$,
  the temperature stays at a relatively high value because both H$_2$ and HD cooling
  saturate, and the cloud evolution is governed by H$_2$ cooling. The contraction
  of a high-density filament is accelerated by effective three-body H$_2$ formation
  when the density reaches 10$^8$-10$^9$ cm$^-3$. Fragmentation is not expected to
  take place until the cloud becomes opaque in H$_2$ lines at n$_c,0$\raisebox-5̊ex~10$^12$-10$^13$
  cm$^-3$, so that the fragment mass is reduced to 1-2 M$_solar$. As a result, the
  stellar initial mass function could be bimodal and deficient in sub-solar mass stars,
  where the high-mass peak is around 10 or 10$^2$ M$_solar$, dependent on n$_c,0$
  and x$_H<SUB>2$,0</SUB>. If the protogalactic clouds are ionized by UV radiation
  or strong shocks, the H$_2$ abundance could exceed x$_H<SUB>2$,cr</SUB >\raisebox-0e̊x~=3×10$^-3$
  by reactions of H+e--&gt;H$^-$+h\ensuremathν and H+H$^-$--&gt;H$_2$+e. The high-mass
  peak would then be O(10)M$_solar$.
