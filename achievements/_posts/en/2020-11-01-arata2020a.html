abstract: Recent observations have successfully detected [O III] $88.3\, m̊ μ m$ and
  [C II] $157.6\, \ ̊μ m$ lines from galaxies in the early Universe with the Atacama
  Large Millimeter Array. Combining cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and radiative
  transfer calculations, we present relations between the metal line emission and
  galaxy evolution at z = 6-15. We find that galaxies during their starburst phases
  have high [O III] luminosity of $∼10^42~\re̊rg~s^-1$ . Once supernova feedback quenches
  star formation, [O III] luminosities rapidly decrease and continue to be zero for
  $∼100\, \rmẙr$ . The slope of the relation between $łog (\rm R̊/\rm Mø̊dot ~ yr^-1)$
  and $łog (L_\rm [O ̊\small III]/\mathrmL_ødot )$ at z = 6-9 is 1.03, and 1.43 for
  $łog (L_\rm [C\\̊small II]/\mathrmL_ødot )$ . As gas metallicity increases from
  sub-solar to solar metallicity by metal enrichment from star formation and feedback,
  the line luminosity ratio $L_\rm [O\,s̊mall III] / L_\rm [C\, m̊all II]$ decreases
  from \ensuremath∼10 to \ensuremath∼1 because the O/C abundance ratio decreases due
  to carbon-rich winds from AGB stars and the mass ratio of H II to H I regions decreases
  due to rapid recombination. Therefore, we suggest that the combination of [O III]
  and [C II] lines is a good probe to investigate the relative distribution of ionized
  and neutral gas in high-z galaxies. In addition, we show that deep [C II] observations
  with a sensitivity of \ensuremath∼10$^-2$ mJy arcsec$^-2$ can probe the extended
  neutral gas discs of high-z galaxies.
