abstract: We present the first stage of an investigation of the interactions of the
  jets in the radio galaxy Hydra A with the intracluster medium. We consider the jet
  kinetic power, the galaxy and cluster atmosphere and the inner structure of the
  radio source. Analysing radio observations of the inner lobes of Hydra A by Taylor
  et al. we confirm the jet power estimates ̃10$^45$ erg s$^-1$ derived by Wise et
  al. from dynamical analysis of the X-ray cavities. With this result and a model
  for the galaxy halo, we explore the jet-intracluster medium interactions occurring
  on a scale of 10 kpc using two-dimensional, axisymmetric, relativistic pure hydrodynamic
  simulations. A key feature is that we identify the three bright knots in the northern
  jet as biconical reconfinement shocks, which result when an overpressured jet starts
  to come into equilibrium with the galactic atmosphere. Through an extensive parameter
  space study we deduce that the jet velocity is approximately 0.8c at a distance
  0.5 kpc from the black hole. The combined constraints of jet power, the observed
  jet radius profile along the jet and the estimated jet pressure and jet velocity
  imply a value of the jet density parameter \ensuremathχ \ensuremath≈ 13 for the
  northern jet. We show that for a jet \ensuremathβ = 0.8 and \ensuremathþeta = 42°,
  an intrinsic asymmetry in the emissivity of the northern and southern jet is required
  for a consistent brightness ratio \ensuremath≈7 estimated from the 6-cm Very Large
  Array image of Hydra A.
