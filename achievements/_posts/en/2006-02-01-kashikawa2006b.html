abstract: We explored the clustering properties of Lyman break galaxies at z=4 and
  5 with an angular two-point correlation function on the basis of the very deep and
  wide Subaru Deep Field data. We confirmed the previous result that the clustering
  strength of LBGs depends on the UV luminosity in the sense that brighter LBGs are
  more strongly clustered. In addition, we found an apparent dependence of the correlation
  function slope on UV luminosity for LBGs at both z=4 and 5. More luminous LBGs have
  a steeper correlation function. The bias parameter was found to be a scale-dependent
  function for bright LBGs, whereas it appears to be almost scale- independent for
  faint LBGs. Luminous LBGs have a higher bias at smaller angular scales, which decreases
  as the scale increases. To compare these observational results, we constructed numerical
  mock LBG catalogs based on a semianalytic model of hierarchical clustering combined
  with high-resolution N-body simulation, carefully mimicking the observational selection
  effects. The luminosity functions and the overall correlation functions for LBGs
  at z=4 and 5 predicted by this mock catalog were found to be almost consistent with
  the observation. The observed dependence of the clustering on UV luminosity was
  not reproduced by the model, unless subsamples of distinct halo mass were considered.
  That is, LBGs belonging to more massive dark halos had steeper and larger amplitude
  correlation functions. With this model, we found that LBG multiplicity in massive
  dark halos amplifies the clustering strength at small scales, which steepens the
  correlation function. The hierarchical clustering model could therefore be reconciled
  with the observed luminosity dependence of the correlation function if there is
  a tight correlation between UV luminosity and halo mass. Our finding that the slope
  of the correlation function depends on luminosity could be an indication that massive
  dark halos hosted multiple bright LBGs. <P />Based on data collected at the Subaru
  Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.
