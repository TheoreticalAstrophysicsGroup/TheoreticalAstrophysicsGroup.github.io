abstract: We present the results of the extensive narrowband survey of Ly\ensuremathα
  emission-line objects at z = 3.1 in the 1.38 deg$^2$ area surrounding the high-density
  region of star- forming galaxies at z = 3.09 in the SSA22 field, as well as in the
  1.04 deg$^2$ area of the three separated general blank fields. In total, of 2161
  Ly\ensuremathα emitters, there are 1394 in the SSA22 fields and 767 in the general
  fields detected at the narrowband AB magnitude limit of 25.73, which corresponds
  to the line flux of \ensuremath≈1.8 × 10$^-17$ erg s$^-1$ cm$^-2$ or the luminosity
  of \ensuremath≈1.5 × 10$^42$ erg s$^-1$ at z = 3.1, above the observed equivalent-width
  threshold, \ensuremath≈190 ̊A. The average surface number density of the emitters
  at z = 3.1 in the general fields above the thresholds is 0.20 \ensuremath± 0.01
  arcmin$^-2$. The SSA22 high-density region at z = 3.09, whose peak local density
  is six times that of the average, is found to be the most prominent outstanding
  structure in the whole surveyed area and is firmly identified as a robust ``protocluster.''
  We also compared the overdensity of the 100 arcmin$^2$ and 700 arcmin$^2$ areas
  which contain the protocluster with the expected fluctuation of the dark matter
  as well as those of the model galaxies in cosmological simulations. We found that
  the peak height values of the overdensity are 8-10 and 3-4 times the expected standard
  deviations for the counts of Ly\ensuremathα emitters at z = 3.1 in the corresponding
  volume, respectively. We conclude that the structure at z = 3.09 in the SSA22 field
  is a very significant and rare density peak up to the scale of \ensuremath≈60 Mpc.
