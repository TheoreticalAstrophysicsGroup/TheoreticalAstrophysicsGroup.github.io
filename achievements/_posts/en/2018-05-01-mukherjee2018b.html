abstract: The interstellar medium of the radio galaxy IC 5063 is highly perturbed
  by an AGN jet expanding in the gaseous disc of the galaxy. We model this interaction
  with relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and multiphase initial conditions for
  the interstellar medium and compare the results with recent observations. As the
  jets flood through the intercloud channels of the disc, they ablate, accelerate,
  and disperse clouds to velocities exceeding 400 km s$^-1$. Clouds are also destroyed
  or displaced in bulk from the central regions of the galaxy. Our models with jet
  powers of 10$^44$ and 10$^45$ erg s$^-1$ are capable of reproducing many of the
  observed features in the position velocity diagram of IC 5063, and confirm the notion
  that the jet is responsible for the strongly perturbed gas dynamics seen in the
  ionized, neutral, and molecular gas phases. In our simulations, we also see strong
  venting of the jet plasma perpendicular to the disc, which entrains clumps and diffuse
  filaments into the halo of the galaxy. Our simulations are the first 3D hydrodynamic
  simulations of the jet and interstellar matter of IC 5063.
