abstract: We have conducted a spectral line survey observation in the 3 mm band toward
  the low-metallicity dwarf galaxy IC10 with the 45 m radio telescope of the Nobeyama
  Radio Observatory to explore its chemical composition at a molecular-cloud scale
  (\ensuremath∼80 pc). The CS, SO, CCH, HCN, HCO$^+$, and HNC lines are detected for
  the first time in this galaxy in addition to the CO and $^13$CO lines, while the
  c-C$_3$H$_2$, CH$_3$OH, CN, C$^18$O, and N$_2$H$^+$ lines are not detected. The
  spectral intensity pattern is found to be similar to those observed toward molecular
  clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), whose metallicity is as low as IC10.
  Nitrogen-bearing species are deficient in comparison with the Galactic molecular
  clouds due to a lower elemental abundance of nitrogen. CCH is abundant in comparison
  with Galactic translucent clouds, whereas CH$_3$OH may be deficient. These characteristic
  trends for CCH and CH$_3$OH are also seen in the LMC, and seem to originate from
  photodissociation regions more extended in the peripheries of molecular clouds due
  to the lower metallicity condition.
