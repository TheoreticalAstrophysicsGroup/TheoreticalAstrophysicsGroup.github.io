abstract: 'We report three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of shocks ( $a̧l
  M_m̊ shock\ge 4$ ) interacting with fractal multicloud layers. The evolution of
  shock-multicloud systems consists of four stages: a shock-splitting phase in which
  reflected and refracted shocks are generated, a compression phase in which the forward
  shock compresses cloud material, an expansion phase triggered by internal heating
  and shock re- acceleration, and a mixing phase in which shear instabilities generate
  turbulence. We compare multicloud layers with narrow ( $σ _\o̊ =1.9\bar\r ̊$ ) and
  wide ( $σ _\rh̊=5.9\barρ$̊ ) lognormal density distributions characteristic of Mach
  ≍ 5 supersonic turbulence driven by solenoidal and compressive modes. Our simulations
  show that outflowing cloud material contains imprints of the density structure of
  their native environments. The dynamics and disruption of multicloud systems depend
  on the porosity and the number of cloudlets in the layers. ''Solenoidal'' layers
  mix less, generate less turbulence, accelerate faster, and form a more coherent
  mixed-gas shell than the more porous ''compressive'' layers. Similarly, multicloud
  systems with more cloudlets quench mixing via a shielding effect and enhance momentum
  transfer. Mass loading of diffuse mixed gas is efficient in all models, but direct
  dense gas entrainment is highly inefficient. Dense gas only survives in compressive
  clouds, but has low speeds. If normalized with respect to the shock-passage time,
  the evolution shows invariance for shock Mach numbers \ensuremath≥10 and different
  cloud-generating seeds, and slightly weaker scaling for lower Mach numbers and thinner
  cloud layers. Multicloud systems also have better convergence properties than single-cloud
  systems, with a resolution of eight cells per cloud radius being sufficient to capture
  their overall dynamics.'
