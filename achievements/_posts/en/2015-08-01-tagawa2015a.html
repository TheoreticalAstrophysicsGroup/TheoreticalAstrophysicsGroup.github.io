abstract: 'We perform numerical simulations on the merger of multiple black holes
  (BHs) in primordial gas at early cosmic epochs. We consider two cases of BH mass:
  M$_BH$ = 30 and 10$^4$ M$_☉$. Attention is concentrated on the effect of the dynamical
  friction by gas in a host object. The simulations incorporate such general relativistic
  effects as the pericentre shift and gravitational wave emission. As a result, we
  find that multiple BHs are able to merge into one BH within 100 Myr in a wide range
  of BH density. The merger mechanism is revealed to be categorized into three types:
  gas-drag-driven merger (type A), interplay-driven merger (type B), and three-body-driven
  merger (type C). We find the relation between the merger mechanism and the ratio
  of the gas mass within the initial BH orbit (M$_gas$) to the total BH mass (\ensuremath∑M$_BH$).
  Type A merger occurs if M$_gas$ \ensuremath\gtrsim 10$^5$\ensuremath∑M$_BH$, type
  B if M$_gas$ \ensuremathłesssim 10$^5$\ensuremath∑M$_BH$, and type C if M$_gas$
  \ensuremathłl 10$^5$\ensuremath∑M$_BH$. Supposing the gas and BH density based on
  the recent numerical simulations on first stars, all the BH remnants from first
  stars are likely to merge into one BH in ̃ 10$^7$ yr through the type B or C mechanism.
  Also, we find that multiple massive BHs (M$_BH$ = 10$^4$ M$_☉$) distributed over
  several parsec can merge into one BH through the type B mechanism, if the gas density
  is higher than 5 × 10$^6$ cm$^-3$. The present results imply that the BH merger
  may contribute significantly to the formation of supermassive BHs at high-redshift
  epochs.'
