<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >We study the production of barium (Ba) and strontium (Sr) in ultrafaint dwarf (UFDs)
galaxies. Both r- and s- processes produce these elements, and one can infer the contribution
of the r-process from the characteristic r-process abundance pattern, whereas the s-process
contribution remains largely unknown. We show that the current s-process yield
from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is not sufficient to explain the Ba and Sr
abundances observed in UFDs. Production of these elements would need to be efficient
from the beginning of star formation in the galaxies. The discrepancy of nearly or
more than 1 dex is not reconciled even if we consider s-process in super-AGB stars.
We consider a possible resolution by assuming rotating massive stars (RMSs) and
electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) as additional contributors. We find that the RMSs
could be the origin of Ba in UFDs if ~10 per cent of massive stars are rotating at
300 km s<sup><span

class="txr-x-x-74">1</span></sup>. As for ECSNe, we argue that their fraction is less than 2 per cent of
core-collapse supernova. It narrows the progenitor mass-range to <span

function (IMF) in UFDs and find a top-light IMF model that reproduces the observed
level of Ba-enrichment. Future observations that determine or tightly constrain the
europium and nitrogen abundances are crucial to identify the origin of Ba and Sr in
UFDs.</p>
