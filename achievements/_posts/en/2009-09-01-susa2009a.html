abstract: We explore the formation of secondary Population III (Pop III) stars under
  radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) feedback by a preformed massive star. To properly treat
  RHD feedback, we perform three-dimensional RHD simulations incorporating the radiative
  transfer of ionizing photons as well as H2 dissociating photons from a preformed
  star. A collapsing gas cloud is settled at a given distance from a 120 M sun Pop
  III star, and the evolution of the cloud is pursued including RHD feedback. We derive
  the threshold density depending on the distance, above which the cloud can keep
  collapsing owing to the shielding of H2 dissociating radiation. We find that an
  H2 shell formed ahead of an ionizing front works effectively to shield the H2 dissociating
  radiation, leading to the positive feedback for the secondary Pop III star formation.
  Also, near the threshold density, the envelope of gas cloud is stripped significantly
  by a shock associated with an ionizing front. By comparing the mass accretion timescale
  with the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, we estimate the mass of secondary Pop III stars.
  It turns out that the stripping by a shock can reduce the mass of secondary Pop
  III stars down to ≈20 M sun.
