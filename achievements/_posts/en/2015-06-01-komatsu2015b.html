abstract: In photosynthetic organisms, light energy is converted into chemical energy
  through the light absorption and excitation energy transfer (EET) processes. These
  processes start in light- harvesting complexes, which contain special photosynthetic
  pigments. The exploration of unique mechanisms in light- harvesting complexes is
  directly related to studies, such as artificial photosynthesis or biosignatures
  in astrobiology. We examined, through ab initio calculations, the light absorption
  and EET processes using cluster models of light-harvesting complexes in purple bacteria
  (LH2). We evaluated absorption spectra and energy transfer rates using the LH2 monomer
  and dimer models to reproduce experimental results. After the calibration tests,
  a LH2 aggregation model, composed of 7 or 19 LH2s aligned in triangle lattice, was
  examined. We found that the light absorption is red shifted and the energy transfer
  becomes faster as the system size increases. We also found that EET is accelerated
  by exchanging the central pigments to lower energy excited pigments. As an astrobiological
  application, we calculated light absorptions efficiencies of the LH2 in different
  photoenvironments. <P />
