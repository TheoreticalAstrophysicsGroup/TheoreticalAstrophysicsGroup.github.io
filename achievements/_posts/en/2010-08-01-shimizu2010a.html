abstract: In the last decade, numerous Lyman \ensuremathα (Ly\ensuremathα) emitters
  (LAEs) have been discovered with narrow-band filters at various redshifts. Recently,
  multiwavelength observations of LAEs have been performed and revealed that while
  many LAEs appear to be young and less massive, a noticeable fraction of LAEs possess
  much older populations of stars and larger stellar mass. How these two classes of
  LAEs are concordant with the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario has not been
  understood clearly so far. In this paper, we model LAEs by three-dimensional cosmological
  simulations of dark halo merger in a \ensuremathŁambda cold dark matter (\ensuremathŁambdaCDM)
  universe. As a result, it is shown that the age of simulated LAEs can spread over
  a wide range from 2 × 10$^6$ to 9 × 10$^8$yr. Furthermore, we find that there are
  two types of LAEs, in one of which the young half-mass age is comparable to the
  mean age of stellar component, and in the other of which the young half-mass age
  is appreciably shorter than the mean age. We define the former as Type 1 LAEs and
  the latter as Type 2 LAEs. A Type 1 LAE corresponds to early starburst in a young
  galaxy, whereas a Type 2 LAE does to delayed starburst in an evolved galaxy, as
  a consequence of delayed accretion of a subhalo on to a larger parent halo. Thus,
  the same halo can experience a Type 2 LAE phase as well as a Type 1 LAE phase in
  the merger history. Type 1 LAEs are expected to be younger than 1.5 × 10$^8$yr,
  less dusty and less massive with stellar mass M$_star$ &lt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 5 × 10$^8$M$_solar$,
  while Type 2 LAEs are older than 1.5 × 10$^8$yr, even dustier and as massive as
  M$_star$ \i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 5 × 10$^8$-3 × 10$^10$M$_solar$. The fraction of Type 2s
  in all LAEs is a function of redshift, which is less than 2 per cent at z &gt;\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~
  4.5, \rae̊box-0.5ex~30 per cent at redshift z = 3.1 and \raib̊ox-0.5ex~70 per cent
  at z = 2. Type 2 LAEs can be discriminated clearly from Type 1s in two-colour diagrams
  of z' - H versus J - K. We find that the brightness distribution of Ly\ensuremathα
  in Type 2 LAEs is more extended than the main stellar component, in contrast to
  Type 1 LAEs. This is not only because delayed starbursts tend to occur in the outskirts
  of a parent galaxy, but also because Ly\ensuremathα photons are effectively absorbed
  by dust in an evolved galaxy. Hence, the extent of Ly\ensuremathα emission may be
  an additional measure to distinguish Type 2 LAEs from Type 1 LAEs. The sizes of
  Type 2 LAEs range from a few tens to a few hundreds kpc. At lower redshifts, the
  number of more extended, older Type 2 LAEs increases. Furthermore, it is anticipated
  that the amplitude of angular correlation function for Type 2 LAEs is significantly
  higher than that for Type 1 LAEs, but comparable to that for Lyman break galaxies
  (LBGs). This implies that LBGs with strong Ly\ensuremathα line may include Type
  2 LAEs.
