abstract: As a possible formation mechanism of glycine in astrophysical environments,
  a reaction path via aminoacetonitrile and hydantoin (2,4-imidazolidinedione), which
  have been detected in an interstellar cloud and meteorites, respectively, were analyzed
  using the density functional theory. The formation of hydantoin from aminoacetonitrile
  via the Bücherer-Bergs reaction and the hydrolysis of hydantoin were investigated.
  The results showed that the catalytic water molecules significantly lower the reaction
  barriers for the formation of hydantoin. Although the highest barrier is still too
  high that the pathway is inactive in an interstellar medium, this reaction would
  proceed during the heating of the meteorite parent body. <P />
