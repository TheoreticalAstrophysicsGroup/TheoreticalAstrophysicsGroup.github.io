abstract: We present new, spatially resolved [CI]1-0, [CI]2-1, CO(7-6), and dust continuum
  observations of 4C 41.17 at z = 3.8. This is one of the best-studied radio galaxies
  in this epoch and is arguably the best candidate of jet-triggered star formation
  at high redshift currently known in the literature. 4C 41.17 shows a narrow ridge
  of dust continuum extending over 15 kpc near the radio jet axis. Line emission is
  found within the galaxy in the region with signatures of positive feedback. Using
  the [CI]1-0 line as a molecular gas tracer, and multifrequency observations of the
  far-infrared dust heated by star formation, we find a total gas mass of 7.6 × 10$^10$
  M$_\ensuremathødot$, which is somewhat greater than that previously found from CO(4-3).
  The gas mass surface density of 10$^3$ M$_\ensuremathødot$ yr$^-1$ pc$^-2$ and the
  star formation rate surface density of 10 M$_\ensuremathødot$ yr$^-1$ kpc$^-2$ were
  derived over the 12 kpc × 8 kpc area, where signatures of positive feedback have
  previously been found. These densities are comparable to those in other populations
  of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies in this redshift range, suggesting that
  the jet does not currently enhance the efficiency with which stars form from the
  gas. This is consistent with expectations from simulations, whereby radio jets may
  facilitate the onset of star formation in galaxies without boosting its efficiency
  over longer timescales, in particular after the jet has broken out of the interstellar
  medium, as is the case in 4C 41.17. \\IRAM data are only available at the CDS via
