abstract: Powerful relativistic jets in radio galaxies are capable of driving strong
  outflows but also inducing star-formation by pressure- triggering collapse of dense
  clouds. We review theoretical work on negative and positive active galactic nuclei
  feedback, discussing insights gained from recent hydrodynamical simulations of jet-driven
  feedback on galaxy scales that are applicable to compact radio sources. The simulations
  show that the efficiency of feedback and the relative importance of negative and
  positive feedback depend strongly on interstellar medium properties, especially
  the column depth and spatial distribution of clouds. Negative feedback is most effective
  if clouds are distributed spherically and individual clouds have small column depths,
  while positive feedback is most effective if clouds are predominantly in a disc-like
  configuration. <P />
