abstract: The quasar mode of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the high-redshift Universe
  is routinely observed in gas-rich galaxies together with large-scale AGN-driven
  winds. It is crucial to understand how photons emitted by the central AGN source
  couple to the ambient interstellar medium to trigger large-scale outflows. By means
  of radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of idealized galactic discs, we study the
  coupling of photons with the multiphase galactic gas, and how it varies with gas
  cloud sizes, and the radiation bands included in the simulations, which are ultraviolet,
  optical, and infrared (IR). We show how a quasar with a luminosity of 10$^46$ erg
  s$^- 1$ can drive large- scale winds with velocities of 102̂-10\ ̂km s\^1̂\ and
  mass outflow rates around 10$^3$ M$_☉$ yr$^- 1$ for times of the order of a few
  million years. IR radiation is necessary to efficiently transfer momentum to the
  gas via multiscattering on dust in dense clouds. However, IR multiscattering, despite
  being extremely important at early times, quickly declines as the central gas cloud
  expands and breaks up, allowing the radiation to escape through low gas density
  channels. The typical number of multiscattering events for an IR photon is only
  about a quarter of the mean optical depth from the centre of the cloud. Our models
  account for the observed outflow rates of ̃500-1000 M$_☉$ yr$^- 1$ and high velocities
  of ̃ 10$^3$ km s$^- 1$, favouring winds that are energy driven via extremely fast
  nuclear outflows, interpreted here as being IR radiatively driven winds.
