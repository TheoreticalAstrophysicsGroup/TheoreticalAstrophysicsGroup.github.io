abstract: We present a scheme for numerical simulations of collisionless self- gravitating
  systems which directly integrates the Vlasov-Poisson equations in six-dimensional
  phase space. Using the results from a suite of large-scale numerical simulations,
  we demonstrate that the present scheme can simulate collisionless self- gravitating
  systems properly. The integration scheme is based on the positive flux conservation
  method recently developed in plasma physics. We test the accuracy of our code by
  performing several test calculations, including the stability of King spheres, the
  gravitational instability, and the Landau damping. We show that the mass and the
  energy are accurately conserved for all the test cases we study. The results are
  in good agreement with linear theory predictions and/or analytic solutions. The
  distribution function keeps the property of positivity and remains non-oscillatory.
  The largest simulations are run on 64$^6$ grids. The computation speed scales well
  with the number of processors, and thus our code performs efficiently on massively
  parallel supercomputers.
