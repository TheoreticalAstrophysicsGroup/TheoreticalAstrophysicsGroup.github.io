abstract: We explore the induction of circular polarization (CP) of near-infrared
  light in star-forming regions using three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations.
  The simulations trace the change of Stokes parameters at each scattering/absorption
  process in a dusty gas slab composed of aligned grains. We find that the CP degree
  enlarges significantly according as the size of dust grains increases and exceeds
  \ensuremath∼20 per cent for micron-sized grains. Therefore, if micron-sized grains
  are dominant in a dusty gas slab, the high CP observed around luminous young stellar
  objects can be accounted for. The distributions of CP show the asymmetric quadrupole
  patterns regardless of the grain sizes. Also, we find that the CP degree depends
  on the relative position of a dusty gas slab. If a dusty gas slab is located behind
  a star-forming region, the CP reaches \ensuremath∼60 per cent in the case of 1.0
  \textmum dust grains. Hence, we suggest that the observed variety of CP maps can
  be explained by different size distributions of dust grains and the configuration
  of aligned grains.
