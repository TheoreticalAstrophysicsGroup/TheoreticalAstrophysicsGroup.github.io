abstract: We present the results of the observations of the Ly\ensuremathα line profiles
  of 91 emission-line galaxies at z = 3.1 with a spectral resolution of \ensuremath\
  lambda/\ensuremathδ\ensuremathłambda(FWHM) \ensuremath≈1700 or 180 km s$^-1$. A
  significant fraction of åisebox-0.5ex~50% of the observed objects show the characteristic
  double peaks in their Ly\ensuremathα profile. The red peak is much stronger than
  the blue one for most of the cases. The red peaks themselves also show weak but
  significant asymmetry and their widths are correlated with the velocity separation
  of the red and the blue peaks. This implies that the peaks are not isolated multiple
  components with different velocities but parts of a single line that are modified
  by the absorption and/or scattering by the associated neutral hydrogen gas. The
  characteristic profile can be naturally explained by scattering in the expanding
  shell of the neutral hydrogen surrounding the Ly\ensuremathα emitting region while
  the attenuation by the intergalactic medium should also be considered. Our results
  suggest that the star formation in these Ly\ensuremathα emitters are dominated by
  young burst-like events that produce the intrinsic Ly\ensuremathα emission as well
  as the gas outflow.
