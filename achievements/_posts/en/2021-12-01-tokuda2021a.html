<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >We have analyzed the data from a large-scale CO survey toward the northern region of the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) obtained with the Atacama Compact Array (ACA)
stand-alone mode of ALMA. The primary aim of this study is to comprehensively
understand the behavior of CO as an H<sub><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sub> tracer in a low-metallicity environment
(Z ~0.2 Z <sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>). The total number of mosaic fields is ~8000, which results in a field
coverage of 0.26 deg<sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sup> (~2.9 <span 
class="tcxr-">×</span>10<sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">5</span></sup> pc<sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sup>), corresponding to ~10% of the area of the
galaxy. The sensitive ~2 pc resolution observations reveal the detailed structure of
the molecular clouds previously detected in the single-dish NANTEN survey. We
have detected a number of compact CO clouds within lower H<sub><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sub> column density
(~10<sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">20</span></sup> cm<sup><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">-</span><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sup>) regions whose angular scale is similar to the ACA beam size. Most of
the clouds in this survey also show peak brightness temperature as low as <1 K,
which for optically thick CO emission implies an emission size much smaller than
the beam size, leading to beam dilution. The comparison between an available
estimation of the total molecular material traced by thermal dust emission and the
present CO survey demonstrates that more than ~90% of H<sub><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sub> gas cannot be traced
by the low-J CO emission. Our processed data cubes and 2D images are publicly
available.</p>
