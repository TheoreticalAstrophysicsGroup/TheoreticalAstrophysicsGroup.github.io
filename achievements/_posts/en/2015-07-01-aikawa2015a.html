abstract: We investigate the chemistry of ion molecules in protoplanetary disks, motivated
  by the detection of the N$_2$H$^+$ ring around TW Hya. While the ring inner radius
  coincides with the CO snow line, it is not apparent why N$_2$H$^+$ is abundant outside
  the CO snow line in spite of the similar sublimation temperatures of CO and N$_2$.
  Using the full gas-grain network model, we reproduced the N$_2$H$^+$ ring in a disk
  model with millimeter grains. The chemical conversion of CO and N$_2$ to less volatile
  species (sink effect hereinafter) is found to affect the N$_2$H$^+$ distribution.
  Since the efficiency of the sink depends on various parameters such as activation
  barriers of grain-surface reactions, which are not well constrained, we also constructed
  the no-sink model; the total (gas and ice) CO and N$_2$ abundances are set constant,
  and their gaseous abundances are given by the balance between adsorption and desorption.
  Abundances of molecular ions in the no-sink model are calculated by analytical formulae,
  which are derived by analyzing the full-network model. The N$_2$H$^+$ ring is reproduced
  by the no-sink model, as well. The 2D (R-Z) distribution of N$_2$H$^+$, however,
  is different among the full-network model and no-sink model. The column density
  of N$_2$H$^+$ in the no-sink model depends sensitively on the desorption rate of
  CO and N$_2$ and the cosmic-ray flux. We also found that N$_2$H$^+$ abundance can
  peak at the temperature slightly below the CO sublimation, even if the desorption
  energies of CO and N$_2$ are the same.
