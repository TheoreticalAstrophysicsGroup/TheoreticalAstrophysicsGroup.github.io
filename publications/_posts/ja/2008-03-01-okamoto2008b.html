abstract: 'In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active
  galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We assume
  that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is transferred to the
  surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical model of mass accretion
  on to black holes with a multiphase description of star-forming gas, we self-consistently
  follow evolution of both galaxies and their central black holes. The novelty in
  our model is that we consider two distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively
  efficient thin accretion discs and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which
  we will generically refer to as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production
  in accretion discs, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback.
  The focus of this paper is to investigate the interplay between galaxies and their
  central black holes during the formation of a disc galaxy. We find that, after an
  initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion rate on to the central
  black hole drops so that the accretion disc switches to a RIAF structure. At this
  point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and slightly suppresses star
  formation in the galactic disc and almost completely halts star formation in the
  bulge. This suppression of the star formation regulates mass accretion on to the
  black hole and associated AGN feedback. As a result, the nucleus becomes a stochastically
  fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent short-lived episodes
  of activity after the star bursts. During the `on'' events, the AGN produces reasonably
  powerful jets (radio-loud state) and is less luminous than the host galaxy, while
  in the `off'' phase, the nucleus is inactive and `radio quiet''. Our model predicts
  several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric luminosity,
  jet powers, the effect on kpc scale of the radio jet and the AGN lifetime, which
  are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies and their radio activity.
  We also find that the ratios between the central black hole mass and the mass of
  the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10-3 regardless of the strength of either supernova
  feedback or AGN feedback because the radiation drag model directly relates the star
  formation activity in the Galactic Centre and the mass accretion rate on to the
  central black hole.'
