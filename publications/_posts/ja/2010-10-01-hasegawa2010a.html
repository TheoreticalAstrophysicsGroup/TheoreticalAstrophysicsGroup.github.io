abstract: We present a novel radiation hydrodynamics code, START, which is a smoothed
  particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme coupled with accelerated radiative transfer.
  The basic idea for the acceleration of radiative transfer is parallel to the tree
  algorithm that is hitherto used to speed up the gravitational force calculation
  in an N-body system. It is demonstrated that the radiative transfer calculations
  can be dramatically accelerated, where the computational time is scaled as Np logNs
  for Np SPH particles and Ns radiation sources. Such acceleration allows us to readily
  include not only numerous sources but also scattering photons, even if the total
  number of radiation sources is comparable to that of SPH particles. Here, a test
  simulation is presented for a multiple source problem, where the results with START
  are compared to those with a radiation SPH code without tree-based acceleration.
  We find that the results agree well with each other if we set the tolerance parameter
  as thetacrit <= 1.0, and then it demonstrates that START can solve radiative transfer
  faster without reducing the accuracy. One of the important applications with START
  is to solve the transfer of diffuse ionizing photons, where each SPH particle is
  regarded as an emitter. To illustrate the competence of START, we simulate the shadowing
  effect by dense clumps around an ionizing source. As a result, it is found that
  the erosion of shadows by diffuse recombination photons can be solved. Such an effect
  is of great significance to reveal the cosmic reionization process.
