abstract: We investigated the evolution of interacting disk galaxies using high-resolution
  N-body/SPH simulations, while taking into account the multiphase nature of the interstellar
  medium. In our high-resolution simulations, a large-scale starburst occurred naturally
  at the collision interface between two gas disks at the first encounter, resulting
  in the formation of star clusters. This is consistent with observations of interacting
  galaxies. The probability distribution function (PDF) of the gas density showed
  a clear change during the galaxy-galaxy encounter. The compression of gas at the
  collision interface between the gas disks first appears as an excess at nH ˜ 10cm-3
  in the PDF, and then it moves to higher densities (nH gtrsim 100 cm-3) in a few
  times 107years, where starburst takes place. After the starburst, the PDF goes back
  to a quasi-steady state. These results give a simple picture of starburst phenomena
  in galaxy-galaxy encounters.
