abstract: Recent multiwaveband observations of Seyfert nuclei and QSOs established
  significant deviations in the spectral shape of the big blue bump from a blackbody
  spectral shape; soft X-ray excess has a spectral index alpha (Fnu~nu-alpha) of 1.6
  and hard X-ray tail with alpha of ~0.7. We construct a disk-corona model which accounts
  for such broadband spectral properties. We study the emission spectrum emerging
  from a vertical disk-corona structure composed of two-temperature plasma by solving
  hydrostatic equilibrium and radiative transfer self-consistently. A fraction f of
  viscous heating due to mass accretion is assumed to be dissipated in a corona with
  a Thomson optical depth of tauc, where advective cooling is also included, and a
  remaining fraction, 1-f, dissipates within a main body of the disk. Our model can
  nicely reproduce the soft X-ray excess with a power-law shape and the hard tail
  extending to ~50 keV. The different spectral slopes (alpha~1.5 below 2 keV and ~0.5
  above) are the results of different emission mechanisms and different sites; the
  former slope is due to unsaturated Comptonization from the innermost zone, and the
  latter is due to a combination of the Comptonization, bremsstrahlung, and a reflection
  of the coronal radiation at the disk-corona boundary from the inner to surrounding
  zone (<=300 Schwarzschild radii). The emergent optical spectrum is redder (alpha~0.3)
  than that of the standard disk (alpha~-0.3), being consistent with observations,
  due to the different efficiencies of spectral hardening of disk emission at different
  radii. Further, we find that the cutoff frequency of the hard X-ray (~coronal electron
  temperature) and broadband spectral shape are insensitive to the black hole mass,
  while the peak frequency of the big blue bump is sensitive to the mass as the peak
  frequency ~M-1/4BH.
