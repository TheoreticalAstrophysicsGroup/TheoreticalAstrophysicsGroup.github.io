abstract: We investigate chemical evolution in Milky Way-like galaxies based on the
  cold dark matter model in which cosmic structures form via hierarchical merging.
  We introduce chemical enrichment due to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) into the Mitaka
  semianalytic galaxy formation model developed by Nagashima & Yoshii. For the first
  time we derive distributions of stellar metallicities and their ratios in Milky
  Way-like galaxies treating chemical enrichment due to SNe Ia in a hierarchical galaxy
  formation model self-consistently. As a first attempt, we assume all SNe Ia to have
  the same lifetime and assume instantaneous recycling for Type II supernovae (SNe
  II). We find that our model reproduces well the metal abundance ratio [O/Fe] against
  [Fe/H] and the iron metallicity distribution function in the solar neighborhood.
  This means that the so-called G dwarf problem is resolved by the hierarchical formation
  of galaxies, and a gas infall term introduced in traditional monolithic collapse
  models to solve this problem is well explained by the mixture of some physical processes
  such as hierarchical merging of dark halos, gas cooling, energy feedback, and injection
  of gas and metals into hot gas due to supernovae. We also discuss how physical processes
  affect the metal abundance ratio by varying the lifetime of SNe Ia, the star formation
  timescale, and the strength of supernova feedback. We find that the supernova feedback
  plays a key role among them, and therefore there is no one-to-one correspondence
  between star formation histories and stellar metallicity ratio distributions.
