abstract: Recently reported infrared (IR) galaxy number counts and cosmic infrared
  background (CIRB) all suggest that galaxies have experienced strong evolution sometime
  in their lifetime. We statistically estimate the galaxy evolution history from these
  data. We find that an order-of-magnitude increase of the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity
  at redshift z=0.5-1.0 is necessary to reproduce the very high CIRB intensity at
  140 mu m reported by Hauser et al. (1998, AAA 070.161.559) and decreases to, even
  at most, a factor of 10 toward z--5, though many variants are allowed within these
  constraints. This evolution history also satisfies the constraints from the galaxy
  number counts obtained by IRAS, ISO and, roughly, SCUBA. The rapid evolution of
  the comoving IR luminosity density required from the CIRB well reproduces the very
  steep slope of galaxy number counts obtained by ISO. We also estimate the cosmic
  star formation history (SFH) from the obtained FIR luminosity density, considering
  the effect of the metal enrichment in galaxies. The derived SFH increases steeply
  with redshift in 0 < z < 0.75, and becomes flat or even declines atz > 0.75 . This
  is consistent with the SFH estimated from the reported ultraviolet luminosity density.
  In addition, we present the performance of the Japanese ASTRO-F FIR galaxy survey.
  We show the expected number counts in the survey. We also evaluate how large a sky
  area is necessary to derive secure information of galaxy evolution up to z-1 from
  the survey, and find that at least 50-300deg2 is required.
