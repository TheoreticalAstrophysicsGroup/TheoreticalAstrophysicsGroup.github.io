abstract: We investigate the gas supply process from a nuclear gas disk to the Galactic
  center by performing two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including self-gravity
  and radiative cooling. We assume that the gas is supplied to the nuclear gas disk
  by the host galaxy disk. We show that many gas clumps are formed in the nuclear
  gas disk after the nuclear gas disk becomes massive enough to become gravitationally
  unstable. Coalescence of the gas clumps leads to the formation of more massive gas
  clumps. Gravitational encounters between these massive gas clumps induce angular
  momentum transfer between the gas clumps. Massive gas clumps that lose their angular
  momentum due to gravitational encounters move to the galactic center. In this way,
  the gas supply to the galactic center is realized. We also perform a numerical simulation
  with twice the spatial resolution to check numerical resolution effects. Time evolution
  of azimuthally averaged surface density distributions in both models agree well
  with each other. The high-mass part of the clump mass function in the low-resolution
  model is in good agreement with that of the high-resolution model, and lower mass
  clumps are well resolved in the high-resolution model. Therefore, we conclude that
  massive gas clumps play a major role in the angular momentum transfer. The gas supply
  rate to the center is about half of the gas supply rate from the host galaxy when
  the whole region of the nuclear gas disk becomes self-gravitationally unstable.
  More massive gas clumps are formed and migrate to the Galactic center in the models
  of the higher gas supply rate from the host galaxy.
