abstract: 'We present the results of structure analyses for a large sample of 426
  Lyalpha emitters (LAEs) at z ~ 2.2 that are observed with the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced
  Camera for Surveys and WFC3-IR during deep extra-galactic legacy surveys. We confirm
  that the merger fraction and the average ellipticity of LAE''s stellar component
  are 10%-30% and 0.4-0.6, respectively, that are comparable with previous study results.
  We successfully identify that some LAEs have a spatial offset between Lyalpha and
  stellar-continuum emission peaks, deltaLyalpha, by ~2.5-4 kpc beyond our statistical
  errors. To uncover the physical origin of strong Lyalpha emission found in LAEs,
  we investigate the Lyalpha equivalent width (EW) dependences of three structural
  parameters: merger fraction, deltaLyalpha, and ellipticity of stellar distribution
  in the range of EW(Lyalpha) = 20-250 Å. Contrary to expectations, we find that the
  merger fraction does not significantly increase with Lyalpha EW. We reveal an anti-correlation
  between deltaLyalpha and EW(Lyalpha) using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. There
  is a trend that the LAEs with a large Lyalpha EW have a small ellipticity. This
  is consistent with the recent theoretical claims that Lyalpha photons can more easily
  escape from face-on disks having a small ellipticity, due to less inter-stellar
  gas along the line of sight, although our K-S test indicates that this trend is
  not statistically significant. Our results of Lyalpha-EW dependence generally support
  the idea that an H I column density is a key quantity determining Lyalpha emissivity.  Based
  on data obtained with the Subaru Telescope operated by the National Astronomical
  Observatory of Japan.'
