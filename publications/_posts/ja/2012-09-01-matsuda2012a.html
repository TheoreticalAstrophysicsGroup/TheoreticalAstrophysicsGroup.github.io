abstract: Using stacks of Lyalpha images of 2128 Lyalpha emitters (LAEs) and 24 proto-cluster
  UV-selected galaxies (LBGs) at z = 3.1, we examine the surface brightness profiles
  of Lyalpha haloes around high-z galaxies as a function of environment and UV luminosity.
  We find that the slopes of the Lyalpha radial profiles become flatter as the Mpc-scale
  LAE surface density increases, but that they are almost independent of the central
  UV luminosity. The characteristic exponential scalelength of the Lyalpha haloes
  appears to be proportional to the square of the LAE surface density (r Ly alpha∝Sigma
  LAE 2). Including the diffuse, extended Lyalpha haloes, the rest-frame Lyalpha equivalent
  width of the LAEs in the densest regions approaches EW0 ˜ 200 Å, the maximum value
  expected for young (<107 yr) galaxies. This suggests that Lyalpha photons formed
  via shock compression by gas outflows or cooling radiation by gravitational gas
  inflows may partly contribute to the illumination of Lyalpha haloes; however, most
  of their Lyalpha luminosity can be explained by photoionization by or by scattering
  of Lyalpha photons produced from H II regions in and around the central galaxies.
  Regardless of the source of Lyalpha photons, if the Lyalpha haloes trace the overall
  gaseous structure, following the dark matter distribution, it is not surprising
  that the Lyalpha spatial extent depends more strongly on the surrounding Mpc-scale
  environment than on the activity of the central galaxies.
