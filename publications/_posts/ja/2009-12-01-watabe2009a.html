abstract: We investigated the relationship between supermassive black hole (SMBH)
  mass and host starburst luminosity in Seyfert galaxies and Palomar-Green quasi-stellar
  objects, focusing on the host galaxy morphology. Host starburst luminosity was derived
  from the 11.3 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon luminosity. We found that the
  SMBH masses of elliptical-dominated host galaxies are more massive than those of
  disc-dominated host galaxies statistically. We also found that the SMBH masses of
  disc-dominated host galaxies seem to be suppressed even under increasing starburst
  luminosity. These findings imply that final SMBH mass is strongly regulated by host
  galaxy morphology. This can be understood by considering the radiation drag model
  as the SMBH growth mechanism, taking into account the radiation efficiency of the
  host galaxy.
