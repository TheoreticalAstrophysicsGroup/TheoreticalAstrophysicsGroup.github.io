abstract: We propose a new evolutionary model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH)
  and a circumnuclear disk (CND), taking into account the mass-supply from a host
  galaxy and the physical states of CND. In the model, two distinct accretion modes
  depending on gravitational stability of the CND play a key role on accreting gas  to
  a SMBH. (i) If the CND is gravitationally unstable, energy feedback from supernovae
  (SNe) supports a geometrically thick, turbulent gas disk. The accretion in this
  mode is dominated by turbulent viscosity, and it is significantly larger than that
  in the mode (ii), i.e.,  the CND is supported by gas pressure. Once the gas supply
  from the host is stopped, the high accretion phase changes to the low one  (mode
  (ii)), but there is a delay with ˜ 108 yr. Through this evolution, the gas-rich
  CND turns into the gas poor stellar disk.  We found that not all the gas supplied
  from the host galaxy to the central 100 pc region accrete onto the SMBH even in
  the high accretion phase (mode (i)), because  the part of gas is used to form stars.
  Moreover, a super-Eddington accretion is possible in the high accretion phase and
  thus the its condition is briefly discussed.
