abstract: 'Aims.We demonstrate that cosmic rays suppress the thermal overstability
  of radiative shocks for a wide range of upstream parameters and initial conditions.
  Methods: .We perform one-dimensional time-dependent two-fluid simulations, introducing
  cosmic rays into overstable radiative shocks. Results: .When a cosmic ray fluid
  is introduced, the oscillations of the shock front are damped and a smooth cosmic
  ray modified shock develops and propagates away from the cold dense layer. A large
  increase in cosmic ray pressure occurs for lower Mach numbers in radiative cosmic
  ray modified shocks than in adiabatic cosmic ray modified shocks. The compression
  ratio is limited to 7 and steady solutions do not exhibit a cold dense layer like
  those in radiative shocks that are not modified by cosmic rays. If the diffusion
  length is much larger than the cooling length, the shock is nearly isothermal. The
  structure of such shocks obtained with the two-fluid code agree well with analytically
  derived solutions for strictly isothermal flow containing cosmic rays.'
