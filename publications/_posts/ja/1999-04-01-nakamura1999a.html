abstract: Performing one-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations coupled with nonequilibrium
  processes for hydrogen molecule formation, we pursue the thermal and dynamical evolution
  of filamentary primordial gas clouds and attempt to make an estimate on the mass
  of Population III stars. The cloud evolution is computed from the central proton
  density nc~102-104 cm-3 up to ~1013 cm-3. It is found that, almost independent of
  initial conditions, a filamentary cloud continues to collapse nearly isothermally
  owing to H2 cooling until the cloud becomes optically thick against the H2 lines
  (nc~1010-1011 cm-3). During the collapse the cloud structure separates into two
  parts, i.e., a denser spindle and a diffuse envelope. The spindle contracts quasi-statically,
  and thus the line mass of the spindle keeps a characteristic value determined solely
  by the temperature (~800 K), which is ~1×103 Msolar pc-1 during the contraction
  from nc~105 cm-3 to 1013 cm-3. Applying a linear theory, we find that the spindle
  is unstable against fragmentation during the collapse. The wavelength of the fastest
  growing perturbation (lambdam) lessens as the collapse proceeds. Consequently, successive
  fragmentation could occur. When the central density exceeds nc~1010-1011 cm-3, the
  successive fragmentation may cease, since the cloud becomes opaque against the H2
  lines and the collapse decelerates appreciably. Resultantly, the minimum value of
  lambdam is estimated to be ~2×10-3 pc. The mass of the first star is then expected
  to be typically ~3 Msolar, which may grow up to ~16 Msolar by accreting the diffuse
  envelope. Thus, the first-generation stars are anticipated to be massive but not
  supermassive.
