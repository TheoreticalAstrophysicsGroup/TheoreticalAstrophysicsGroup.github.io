abstract: We investigate the properties of satellite galaxies in cosmological N-body/smooth
  particle hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy formation in Milky Way-sized haloes.
  Because of their shallow potential wells, satellite galaxies are very sensitive
  to heating processes which affect their gas content. Their properties can therefore
  be used to constrain the nature of feedback processes that regulate galaxy formation.
  In our simulations, we assume that all the energy produced by supernovae is used
  as kinetic energy to drive galactic winds. Several of our simulations produce bright,
  disc-dominated galaxies. We find that wind models in which the wind speed, vw, is
  proportional to the local velocity dispersion of the dark matter, (and thus the
  wind mass-loading, ), make star formation in satellites sporadic, reproduce the
  observed satellite luminosity function reasonably well (down to Mv=-7) and match
  the luminosity-metallicity relation observed in the Local Group satellites. By contrast,
  models that assume a constant wind speed overproduce faint satellites and predict
  an incorrect luminosity-metallicity relation. Our simulations therefore suggest
  that the feedback processes that operate on the scale of satellite galaxies should
  generate galactic outflows whose mass-loading varies inversely with the depth of
  the potential.
