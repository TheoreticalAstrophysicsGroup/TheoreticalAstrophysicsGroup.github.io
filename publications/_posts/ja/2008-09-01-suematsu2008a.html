abstract: High time cadence unprecedented images at the limb with Ca II H line filtergraph
  from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard Hinode have revealed that a spicule
  consists of highly dynamic multi-threads (typically twin) as thin as a few tenths
  of an arcsecond, and shows prominent lateral movement or oscillation with rotation
  on its axis during its life. This multi-thread structure and lateral motion indicate
  that the spicules can be driven by magnetic reconnection at unresolved spatial scales
  at their footpoints.
