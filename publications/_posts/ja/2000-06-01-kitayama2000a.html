abstract: To explain the effects of the ultraviolet (UV) background radiation on the
  collapse of pre-galactic clouds, we implement a radiation-hydrodynamical calculation,
  combining one-dimensional spherical hydrodynamics with an accurate treatment of
  the radiative transfer of ionizing photons. Both absorption and scattering of UV
  photons are explicitly taken into account. It turns out that a gas cloud contracting
  within the dark matter potential does not settle into hydrostatic equilibrium, but
  undergoes run-away collapse even under the presence of the external UV field. The
  cloud centre is shown to become self-shielded against ionizing photons by radiative
  transfer effects before shrinking to the rotation barrier. Based on our simulation
  results, we further discuss the possibility of H2 cooling and subsequent star formation
  in a run-away collapsing core. The present results are closely relevant to the survival
  of subgalactic Population III objects as well as to metal injection into intergalactic
  space.
