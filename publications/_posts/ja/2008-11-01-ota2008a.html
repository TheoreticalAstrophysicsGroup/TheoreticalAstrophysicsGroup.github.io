abstract: 'Context: We present the results of our analysis of long Suzaku observations
  (149 ks and 122 ks for XIS and HXD, respectively) of the most X-ray luminous galaxy
  cluster, RX J1347.5-1145, at z=0.451.  Aims: To understand the gas physics of a
  violent, cluster merger, we study physical properties of the hot ( 20 keV) gas clump
  in the south-east (SE) region discovered previously by Sunyaev-Zel''dovich (SZ)
  effect observations. Using hard X-ray data, a signature of non-thermal emission
  is also explored.  Methods: We perform single as well as multi-temperature fits
  to the Suzaku XIS spectra. The Suzaku XIS and HXD, and the Chandra ACIS-I data are
  then combined to examine the properties of the hot gas component in the SE region.
  We finally look for non-thermal emission in the Suzaku HXD data.  Results: The single-temperature
  model fails to reproduce the 0.5-10 keV continuum emission and Fe-K lines measured
  by XIS simultaneously. A two-temperature model with a very hot component improves
  the fit, although the XIS data can only provide a lower limit to the temperature
  of the hot component. In the Suzaku HXD data, we detect hard X-ray emission above
  the background in the 12-40 keV band at the 9sigma level; however, the significance
  becomes marginal when the systematic error in the background estimation is included.
  With the joint analysis of the Suzaku and Chandra data, we determine the temperature
  of the hot gas in the SE region to be 25.3+6.1-4.5 (statistical; 90% confidence
  level) +6.9-9.5 (systematic; 90% confidence level) keV, which is in an excellent
  agreement with the previous joint analysis of the SZ effect in radio and the Chandra
  X-ray data. This is the first time that the X-ray analysis alone provides a good
  measurement of the hot component temperature in the SE region, which is possible
  because of Suzaku''s unprecedented sensitivity over the wide X-ray band. These results
  indicate strongly that RX J1347.5-1145 has undergone a recent, violent merger. The
  spectral analysis shows that the SE component is consistent with being thermal.
  We measure the 3sigma upper limit to the non-thermal flux, F<8×10-12 erg s-1 cm^{-2}
  in the 12-60 keV band, which provides a limit on the inverse Compton scattering
  of relativistic electrons off the CMB photons. Combining this limit with the discovery
  of a radio mini halo in this cluster at 1.4 GHz, which measures the synchrotron
  radiation, we find a lower limit to the strength of the intracluster magnetic field,
  such that B>0.007 {mu G}.'
