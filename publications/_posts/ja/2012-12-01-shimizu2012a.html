abstract: We use large cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to
  study the formation and evolution of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs). In our previous
  work, we studied the statistical properties of ultraviolet-selected star-forming
  galaxies at high redshifts. We populate the same cosmological simulations with SMGs
  by calculating the reprocessing of stellar light by dust grains into far-infrared
  to millimetre wavebands in a self-consistent manner. We generate light-cone outputs
  to compare directly the statistical properties of the simulated SMGs with available
  observations. Our model reproduces the submillimetre source number counts and the
  clustering amplitude. We show that bright SMGs with flux S > 1 mJy reside in haloes
  with masses of ˜1013 M&sun; and have stellar masses greater than 1011 M&sun;. The
  angular cross-correlation between the SMGs and Lyman alpha emitters is significantly
  weaker than that between the SMGs and Lyman-break galaxies. The cross-correlation
  is also weaker than the autocorrelation of the SMGs. The redshift distribution of
  the SMGs shows a broad peak at z ˜ 2, where bright SMGs contribute significantly
  to the global cosmic star formation rate density. Our model predicts that there
  are hundreds of SMGs with S > 0.1 mJy at z > 5 per 1 deg2 field. Such SMGs can be
  detected by ALMA.
