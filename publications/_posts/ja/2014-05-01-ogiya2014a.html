abstract: Observations have revealed interesting universal properties of dark matter
  (DM) haloes especially around low-mass galaxies. Strigari et al. showed that DM
  haloes have common enclosed masses within 300 pc (Strigari relation). Kormendy &
  Freeman reported DM haloes having almost identical central surface densities (the
  mu0D relation). In addition, there exists a core-cusp problem, a discrepancy of
  the central density distribution between simulated haloes and observations. We investigate
  whether a scenario where cuspy haloes transform into cores by some dynamical processes
  can also explain their universal structural properties. It is shown that a cusp-to-core
  transformation model naturally reproduces the mu0D relation and that Strigari relation
  follows from the mu0D relation for dwarf galaxies. We also show that the central
  densities of cored dark haloes provide valuable information about their formation
  redshifts. L121
