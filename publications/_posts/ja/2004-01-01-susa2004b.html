abstract: We reanalyze the photoevaporation problem of subgalactic objects irradiated
  by ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation in a reionized universe. For the purpose,
  we perform three-dimensional radiation smoothed particle hydrodynamics (RSPH) calculations,
  in which the radiative transfer is solved by a direct method and the nonequilibrium
  chemistry of primordial gas including H2 molecules is also incorporated. Attention
  is concentrated on radiative transfer effects on the UVB for the formation of subgalactic
  objects with Tvir<~104 K. We consider a reionization model with zreion~7 and also
  the earlier reionization model (zreion~17) inferred by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
  Probe (WMAP). We find that star formation is suppressed appreciably by UVB, but
  baryons at high-density peaks are self-shielded even during the reionization, forming
  some amount of stars eventually. In that sense, the photoevaporation for subgalactic
  systems is not as perfect as argued by one-dimensional spherical calculations. The
  final stellar fraction depends on the collapse epoch and the mass of the system,
  almost regardless of the reionization epoch. For instance, a few tenths of the formed
  stars are born after the cosmic reionization in the zreion~7 model, while more than
  90% of the stars are born after the reionization in the WMAP reionization model.
  Thus, the effects of UVB feedback on the substructure problem with a cold dark matter
  (CDM) scenario should be evaluated with careful treatment of the radiative transfer.
  The star clusters formed at high-density peaks coalesce with each other in a dissipationless
  fashion in a dark matter potential, as a resultant forming a spheroidal system.
  As a result, these low-mass galaxies have large mass-to-light ratios, such as observed
  in dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group.
