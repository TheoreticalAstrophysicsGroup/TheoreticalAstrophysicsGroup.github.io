abstract: We performed three-dimensional N-body/SPH simulations to study how mass
  resolution and other model parameters, such as the star-formation efficiency parameter,
  C* and the threshold density for star formation, nth affect structures of the galactic
  gaseous/stellar disk. We employed 106 - 107 particles to resolve a cold ( T < 100K)
  and dense ( nH > 100cm-3) phase as well as diffuse, hot phases. We found that structures
  of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the distribution of young stars were sensitive
  to the assumed values of nth. High-nth models with nth = 100cm-3 yielded clumpy
  multi-phase features in the ISM. Young stars were distributed in a thin disk, of
  which the half-mass scale height was 10-30pc. In low-nth models with nth = 0.1cm-3,
  which is usually employed in cosmological galaxy-formation simulations, the gas
  disk appears to be smoother and the stellar disk is found to be several-times thicker
  than the high-nth models. A high-resolution simulation with high-nth is necessary
  to reproduce the complex structure of the gas disk. The global star-formation properties
  of galaxies, such as the star-formation history, in low-nth models are similar to
  those in high-nth models when we tune the value of C* so that they reproduce the
  observed relation between the surface gas density and the surface star-formation
  rate density. We however emphasize that  high-nth models automatically reproduce
  the relation, regardless of the values of C*. The ISM structure, phase distribution
  and distributions of young star-forming regions are quite similar in runs with different
  values of C*. We found that the timescale of the flow from the reservoir (nth ˜
  1 cm-3) to the star-forming regions (nth gsim 100 cm-3) is about five-times as long
  as the local dynamical time, and this evolution timescale is independent of the
  value of C*. The use of a high-nth criterion for star formation in high-resolution
  simulations makes numerical models fairy insensitive to the modeling of star formation.
