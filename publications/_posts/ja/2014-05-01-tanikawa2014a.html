abstract: We perform N-body simulations on a multiple massive black hole (MBH) system
  in a host galaxy to derive the criteria for successive MBH merger. The calculations
  incorporate the dynamical friction by stars and general relativistic effects as
  pericentre shift and gravitational wave recoil. The orbits of MBHs are pursed down
  to 10 Schwarzschild radii (˜1 au). As a result, it is shown that about a half of
  MBHs merge during 1 Gyr in a galaxy with mass 1011 M&sun; and stellar velocity dispersion
  240 km s-1, even if the recoil velocity is two times as high as the stellar velocity
  dispersion. The dynamical friction allows a binary MBH to interact frequently with
  other MBHs, and then the decay of the binary orbits leads to the merger through
  gravitational wave radiation, as shown by Tanikawa & Umemura. We derive the MBH
  merger criteria for the masses, sizes, and luminosities of host galaxies. It is
  found that the successive MBH mergers are expected in bright galaxies, depending
  on redshifts. Furthermore, we find that the central stellar density is reduced by
  the sling-shot mechanism and that high-velocity stars with ˜1000 km s-1 are generated
  intermittently in extremely radial orbits.
