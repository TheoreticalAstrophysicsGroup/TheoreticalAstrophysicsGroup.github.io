abstract: We apply the Hermite-Bieler theorem in the analysis of the effect of cosmic
  rays on the thermal stability of an initially uniform, static background. The cosmic
  rays were treated in a fluid approximation and the diffusion coefficient was assumed
  to be constant in time and space. The inclusion of cosmic rays does not alter the
  criterion for the thermal stability of a medium subjected to isobaric perturbations.
  It does alter the criteria for the stability of a medium perturbed by small amplitude
  sound waves. In the limit of a high background cosmic ray pressure to thermal pressure
  ratio, the instability in response to high frequency sound waves is suppressed.
