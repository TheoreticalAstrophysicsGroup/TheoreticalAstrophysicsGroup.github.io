abstract: We present Particle-Particle-Particle-Mesh (PPPM) and Tree Particle-Mesh
  (TreePM) implementations on GRAPE-5 and GRAPE-6A systems, special-purpose hardware
  accelerators for gravitational many-body simulations. In our PPPM and TreePM implementations
  on GRAPE, the computational time is significantly reduced compared with the conventional
  implementations without GRAPE, especially under strong particle clustering, and
  is almost constant irrespective of the degree of particle clustering. We describe
  our survey of two simulation parameters, the PM grid spacing and the opening parameter
  for the most optimal combination of force accuracy and computational speed. We also
  describe the parallelization of these implementations on a PC-GRAPE cluster, in
  which each node has one GRAPE board, and present the optimal configuration of simulation
  parameters for good parallel scalability.
