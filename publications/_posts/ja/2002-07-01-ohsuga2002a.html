abstract: We investigate the photon-trapping effects in the supercritical black hole
  accretion flows by solving radiation transfer as well as the energy equations of
  radiation and gas. It is found that the slim-disk model generally overestimates
  the luminosity of the disk around the Eddington luminosity (LE) and is not accurate
  in describing the effective temperature profile since it neglects time delay between
  energy generation deeper inside the disk and energy release at the surface. The
  photon-trapping effects are especially appreciable even below L~LE, while they appear
  above ~3LE according to the slim disk. Through the photon-trapping effects, the
  luminosity is reduced and the effective temperature profile becomes flatter than
  r-3/4, as in the standard disk. In the case in which the viscous heating is effective
  only around the equatorial plane, the luminosity is kept around the Eddington luminosity
  even at a very large mass accretion rate, M>>LE/c2. The effective temperature profile
  is almost flat, and the maximum temperature decreases in accordance with a rise
  in the mass accretion rate. Thus, the most luminous radius shifts to the outer region
  when M/(LE/c2)>>102. In the case in which the energy is dissipated equally at any
  height, the resultant luminosity is somewhat larger than in the former case, but
  the energy conversion still efficiently decreases with an increase of the mass accretion
  rate as well. The most luminous radius stays around the inner edge of the disk in
  the latter case. Hence, the effective temperature profile is sensitive to the vertical
  distribution of energy production rates, as is the spectral shape. Future observations
  of high L/LE objects will be able to test our model.
