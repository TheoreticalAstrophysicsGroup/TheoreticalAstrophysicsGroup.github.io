abstract: We investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of star clusters in a steady
  tidal field produced by its parent galaxy. In this paper, we focus on the influence
  of the mass profile of the parent galaxy. Previous studies were done with simplification,
  where the parent galaxy was expressed by the point mass. We express different mass
  profiles of the parent galaxy by the tidal fields in which the ratios of the epicyclic
  frequency, kappa, to the angular velocity, omega are different. We compare the mass-loss
  timescale of star clusters whose tidal radii are identical, but in parent galaxies
  with different mass profiles, by means of orbits calculations in fixed cluster potential
  and N-body simulations. In this situation, a cluster rotates around the parent galaxy
  more rapidly, since the parent galaxy has a shallower mass profile. We found that
  the mass-loss timescale increase by 20% and 50% for the cases that the mass-density
  profiles of the parent galaxies are proportional to R-2 and R-1.5, where R is the
  distance from the galaxy center, compared to the point-mass case, in a moderately
  strong tidal field. Counterintuitively, a cluster that rotates around the parent
  galaxy more rapidly has a longer lifetime. The increase of the lifetime is due to
  the fact that the fraction occupied by a regular-like orbit increases in a shallower
  profile. Finally, we derive an evaluation formula for the mass-loss timescale of
  clusters. Our formula can explain a property of the population of the observed galactic
  globular clusters, that their half-mass radii become smaller as their distances
  from the galactic center become smaller.
