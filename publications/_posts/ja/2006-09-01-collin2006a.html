abstract: 'Context: .Scatter around the relationship between central black hole masses
  in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) obtained by reverberation-mapping methods and host-galaxy
  bulge velocity dispersion indicates that the masses are uncertain typically by a
  factor of about three. Aims: .In this paper, we try to identify the sources and
  systematics of this uncertainty. Methods: .We characterize the broad Hbeta emission-line
  profiles by the ratio of their full-width at half maximum (FWHM) to their line dispersion,
  i.e., the second moment of the line profile. We use this parameter to separate the
  reverberation-mapped AGNs into two populations, the first with narrower Hbeta lines
  that tend to have relatively extended wings, and the second with broader lines that
  are relatively flat-topped. The first population is characterized by higher Eddington
  ratios than the second. Within each population, we calibrate the black-hole mass
  scale by comparison of the reverberation-based mass with that predicted by the bulge
  velocity dispersion. We also use the distribution of ratios of the reverberation-based
  mass to the velocity-dispersion mass prediction in a comparison with a "generalized
  thick disk" model in order to see if inclination can plausibly account for the observed
  distribution. Results: .We find that the line dispersion is a less biased parameter
  in general than FWHM for black hole mass estimation, although we show that it is
  possible to empirically correct for the bias introduced by using FWHM to characterize
  the emission-line width. We also argue that inclination effects are apparent only
  in some small subset of the reverberation-based mass measurements; it is primarily
  the objects with the narrowest emission lines that seem to be most strongly affected.
  Conclusions: .Our principal conclusion is that the Hbeta profile is sensitive primarily
  to Eddington ratio, but that inclination effects play a role in some cases.'
