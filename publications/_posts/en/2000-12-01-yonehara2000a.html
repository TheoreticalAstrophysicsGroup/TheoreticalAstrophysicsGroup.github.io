abstract: The innermostregion of quasars can be resolved by microlensing on scales
  down to a few AU. For this purpose, X-rays originating from the innermost regions
  can be selectively amplified by microlensing resulting from the ``caustic crossing''
  events, and observations at X-ray bands are most preferable. If the observation
  has been done, lower limits of black hole mass will be determined, because information
  about gravitational potential of the black hole which is surrounded by accretion
  disk will be obtained
