abstract: 'The conventional wisdom for the formation of the first hard binary in core
  collapse is that three-body interactions of single stars form many soft binaries,
  most of which are quickly destroyed, but eventually one of them survives. We report
  on direct N-body simulations to test these ideas, for the first time. We find that
  the assumptions are incorrect in the majority of the cases: (1) quite a few three-body
  interactions produce a hard binary from scratch; (2) in many cases there are more
  than three bodies directly and simultaneously involved in the production of the
  first binary. The main reason for the discrepancies is that the core of a star cluster,
  at the first deep collapse, contains typically only five or so stars. Therefore,
  the homogeneous background assumption, which still would be reasonable for, say,
  25 stars, utterly breaks down. There have been some speculations in this direction,
  but we demonstrate this result here explicitly, for the first time.'
