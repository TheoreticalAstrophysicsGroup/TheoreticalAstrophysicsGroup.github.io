abstract: We report on X-ray spectral and timing results of a new black hole candidate
  (BHC), MAXI J1659-152, with an orbital period of 2.41 hr (shortest among BHCs) in
  a 2010 outburst from 65 Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations and 8 simultaneous
  Swift and RXTE observations. According to the definitions of the spectral states
  in Remillard and McClintock (2006, ARA&A, 44, 49), most of the observations have
  been classified into the intermediate state. All of the X-ray broadband spectra
  can be modeled by a multi-color disk plus a power-law with an exponential cutoff
  or a multi-color disk plus a Comptonization component. During the initial phase
  of the outburst, a high-energy cutoff was visible at 30-40 keV. The innermost radius
  of the disk gradually decreased by a factor of more than 3 from the onset of the
  outburst, and reached a constant value of 35d10cos i-1/2 km, where d10 is the distance
  in units of 10 kpc and i is the inclination. The type-C quasi-periodic oscillation
  (QPO) frequency varied from 1.6 Hz to 7.3 Hz in association with a change of the
  innermost radius, while the innermost radius remained constant during the type-B
  QPO detections at 1.6-4.1 Hz. Hence, we suggest that the origin of the type-B QPOs
  is different from that of type-C QPOs, the latter of which would originate from
  the disk truncation radius. Assuming the constant innermost radius in the latter
  phase of the outburst as the innermost stable circular orbit, the black hole mass
  in MAXI J1659-152 is estimated to be 3.6-8.0M&sun; for a distance of 5.3-8.6 kpc
  and an inclination angle of 60$\,^{i̧rc}$-75$\,^{i̧rc}$.
