abstract: Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) and Narrow-Line quasars (NLQs) seem
  to amount to ˜ 10-30% of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe. Together
  with their average accretion rate, we argue that a black hole (BH) growth by factor
  of 8-800 happens in these super-Eddington accretion phase of AGNs. Moreover, there
  is a possible, systematic underestimation of accretion rates (in the Eddington unit)
  due to an overestimation of BH mass by massive accretion discs for super-Eddington
  objects. If it is true, the factor of BH growth above may be larger by order(s)
  of magnitude. In contrast, the growth factor expected in sub-Eddington phase is
  only ˜ 2. Therefore, the cosmic BH growth by accretion is likely dominated by super-Eddington
  phase, rather than sub-Eddington phase which is the majority among AGNs.  This analysis
  is based on the fraction and the average accretion rate of NLS1s and NLQs obtained
  for z ≲ 0.5. If those numbers are larger at higher redshift (where BHs were probably
  less grown), super-Eddington accretion would be even more important in the context
  of cosmic BH growth history.
