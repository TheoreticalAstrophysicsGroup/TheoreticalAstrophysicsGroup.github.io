abstract: The smallest dark matter halos are formed first in the early universe. According
  to recent studies, the central density cusp is much steeper in these halos than
  in larger halos and scales as rhovpropr -(1.5 -1.3). We present the results of very
  large cosmological N-body simulations of the hierarchical formation and evolution
  of halos over a wide mass range, beginning from the formation of the smallest halos.
  We confirmed early studies that the inner density cusps are steeper in halos at
  the free streaming scale. The cusp slope gradually becomes shallower as the halo
  mass increases. The slope of halos 50 times more massive than the smallest halo
  is approximately -1.3. No strong correlation exists between the inner slope and
  the collapse epoch. The cusp slope of halos above the free streaming scale seems
  to be reduced primarily due to major merger processes. The concentration, estimated
  at the present universe, is predicted to be 60-70, consistent with theoretical models
  and earlier simulations, and ruling out simple power law mass-concentration relations.
  Microhalos could still exist in the present universe with the same steep density
  profiles.
