abstract: An open question remains whether Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) really
  contain intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We carefully investigated the XMM-Newton
  EPIC spectra of four ULXs that were claimed to be strong candidates of IMBHs by
  several authors. We first tried fitting by the standard spectral model of disk blackbody
  (DBB) + power-law (PL), finding good fits to all of the data, in agreement with
  others. We, however, found that the PL component dominates the DBB component at
  ˜0.3 to 10keV. Thus, the black hole parameters derived solely from the minor DBB
  component are questionable. Next, we tried to fit the same data by the ``p-free
  disk model'' without the PL component, assuming an effective temperature profile
  of Teff ∝ r-p, where r is the disk radius. Interestingly, in spite of one less free-model
  parameter, we obtained similarly good fits with much higher innermost disk temperatures,
  1.8 < kTin < 3.2keV. More importantly, we obtained p ˜ 0.5, just the value predicted
  by the slim (super-critical) disk theory, rather than p = 0.75 that is expected
  from the standard disk model. The estimated black hole masses from the p-free disk
  model are much smaller; M lesssim 40Modot. Furthermore, we applied a more sophisticated
  slim-disk model by Kawaguchi (2003, ApJ, 593, 69), and obtained good fits with roughly
  consistent black hole masses. We thus conclude that the central engines of these
  ULXs are super-critical accretion flows to stellar-mass black holes.
