abstract: Based on a three-dimensional model of an early star-forming galaxy, we explore
  the evolution of the sub-millimetre brightness. The model galaxy is employed from
  an ultra-high-resolution chemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori
  & Umemura, where the star formation rate (SFR) is ˜10 M&sun; yr-1 at tage≲ 0.3 Gyr
  and several M&sun; yr-1 at tage >0.3 Gyr. The former phase well reproduces the observed
  properties of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) and the latter does Lyman break galaxies
  (LBGs). We solve the three-dimensional radiative transfer in the clumpy interstellar
  media in this model galaxy, taking the size distributions of dust grains into account,
  and calculate the dust temperature as a function of galactic evolutionary time.
  We find that the clumpiness of interstellar media plays an important role for the
  sub-millimetre brightness. In the LAE phase, dust grains are concentrated on clumpy
  star-forming regions that are distributed all over the galaxy, and the grains can
  effectively absorb ultraviolet (UV) radiation from stars. As a result, the dust
  is heated up to Tdust≳35 K. In the LBG phase, the continuous supernovae drive dust
  grains far away from star-forming regions. Then, the grains cannot absorb much radiation
  from stars, and become a cold state close to the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
  temperature. Consequently, the dust temperature decreases with the evolutionary
  time, where the mass-weighted mean temperature is Tdust= 26 K at tage= 0.1 Gyr and
  Tdust= 21 K at tage= 1.0 Gyr. By this analysis, it turns out that the sub-millimetre
  brightness is higher in the LAE phase than that in the LBG phase, although the dust-to-gas
  ratio increases monotonically as a function of time. We derive the spectral energy
  distributions by placing the model galaxy at a given redshift. The peak flux at
  850 mu m is found to be S850˜ 0.2-0.9 mJy if the model galaxy is placed at 6 >=z>=
  2. This means that Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) can detect
  an early star-forming galaxy with SFR of ˜10 M&sun; yr-1 by less than one hour integration
  with 16 antennas.
