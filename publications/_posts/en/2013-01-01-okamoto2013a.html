abstract: More than half of nearby disc galaxies have pseudo-bulges, instead of classical
  bulges that are thought to be end-products of galaxy mergers. Pseudo-bulges are
  presumed to develop over time as a result of the secular evolution of galaxy discs.
  We report on simulations of galaxy formation, in which two disc galaxies with discy
  pseudo-bulges have formed. Based on the profile decomposition, the bulge-to-total
  mass ratio of the simulated galaxies is 0.6 for one galaxy and 0.3 for the other.
  We find that the main formation mechanism of the pseudo-bulges in our simulations
  is not the secular evolution of discs but high-redshift starbursts. The progenitors
  of the pseudo-bulges form as high-redshift discs with small scalelengths by the
  rapid supply of low angular momentum gas. By redshift 2, before the main disc formation,
  pseudo-bulge formation has largely completed in terms of mass. The secular evolution,
  such as bar instability, accounts for about 30 per cent of the bulge mass for one
  galaxy and only ˜13 per cent for the other. However, it does affect the final shape
  and kinematic properties of the pseudo-bulges.
