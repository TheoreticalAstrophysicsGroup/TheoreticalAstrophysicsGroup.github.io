abstract: We report an extensive search for Lyalpha emitters (LAEs) at z=6.5 in the
  Subaru Deep Field. Subsequent spectroscopy with Subaru and Keck identified eight
  more LAEs, giving a total of 17 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at z=6.5. Based
  on this spectroscopic sample of 17, complemented by a photometric sample of 58 LAEs,
  we have derived a more accurate Lyalpha luminosity function of LAEs at z=6.5, which
  reveals an apparent deficit at the bright end of ~0.75 mag fainter L*, compared
  with that observed at z=5.7. The difference in the LAE luminosity functions between
  z=5.7 and 6.5 is significant at the 3 sigma level, which is reduced to 2 sigma when
  cosmic variance is taken into account. This result may imply that the reionization
  of the universe has not been completed at z=6.5. We found that the spatial distribution
  of LAEs at z=6.5 was homogeneous over the field. We discuss the implications of
  these results for the reionization of the universe.  The data presented herein were
  partly obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific
  partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California,
  and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made
  possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.  Based
  in part on data collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National
  Astronomical Observatory of Japan.
