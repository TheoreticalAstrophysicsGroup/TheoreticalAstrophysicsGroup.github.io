abstract: We study the formation and evolution of H II regions around the first stars
  formed at redshifts z=10-30. We use a one-dimensional Lagrangian hydrodynamics code
  that self-consistently incorporates radiative transfer and nonequilibrium primordial
  gas chemistry. The star-forming region is defined as a spherical dense molecular
  gas cloud with a Population III star embedded at the center. We explore a large
  parameter space by considering, as plausible early star-forming sites, dark matter
  halos of mass Mhalo=105-108 Msolar, gas density profiles with a power-law index
  w=1.5-2.25, and metal-free stars of mass Mstar=25-500 Msolar. The formation of the
  H II region is characterized by initial slow expansion of a weak D-type ionization
  front near the center, followed by rapid propagation of an R-type front throughout
  the outer gas envelope. We find that the transition between the two front types
  is indeed a critical condition for the complete ionization of halos of cosmological
  interest. In small-mass (<~106 Msolar) halos, the transition takes place within
  a few 105 yr, yielding high escape fractions (>80%) of both ionizing and photodissociating
  photons. The gas is effectively evacuated by a supersonic shock, with the mean density
  within the halo decreasing to <~1 cm-3 in a few million years. In larger mass (>~107
  Msolar) halos, the ionization front remains to be of D-type over the lifetime of
  the massive star, the H II region is confined well inside the virial radius, and
  the escape fractions are essentially zero. We derive an analytic formula that reproduces
  well the results of our simulations for the critical halo mass below which the gas
  is completely ionized. We discuss immediate implications of the present results
  for the star formation history and early reionization of the universe.
