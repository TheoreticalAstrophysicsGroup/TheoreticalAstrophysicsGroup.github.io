abstract: Recently discovered large-scale structure of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs)
  raises a novel challenge to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. The structure
  is extended over more than 50 Mpc at redshift z = 3.1, and exhibits a considerably
  weak angular correlation. Such properties of LAE distributions appear to be incompatible
  with the standard biased galaxy formation scenario in the CDM cosmology. In this
  Letter, by considering the possibility that LAEs are short-lived events, we attempt
  to build up the picture of LAEs concordant with the CDM cosmology. We find that
  if the lifetime of LAEs is as short as , the distributions of simulated galaxies
  successfully match the extension and morphology of large-scale structure of LAEs
  at z = 3.1, and also the weak angular correlation function. This result implies
  that LAEs at z = 3.1 do not necessarily reside in high density peaks, but tends
  to be located in less dense regions, in a different way from the expectation by
  the standard biased galaxy formation scenario. In addition, we make a prediction
  for the angular correlation function of LAEs at redshifts higher than 3. It is found
  that the prediction deviates from that made by the standard biased galaxy formation
  scenario even at redshifts 4 <~ z <~ 6.
