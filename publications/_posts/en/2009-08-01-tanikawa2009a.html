abstract: We have investigated the effects of the hardness of primordial binaries
  on the whole evolution of star clusters by means of N-body simulations. Using a
  newly developed code, GORILLA, we simulated eleven N = 16384 clusters with primordial
  binaries whose binding energies are equal in each cluster in the range of 1--300kT0,
  where 1.5kT0 is the average stellar kinetic energy at the initial time. We found
  that, in both the soft (<=3kT0) and hard (>=300kT0) limits, clusters experience
  deep core collapse. For intermediate hardness (10--100kT0), the core collapses halt
  halfway due to an energy releases of the primordial binaries. The core radii at
  the halt can be explained by their energy budget.
