abstract: 'In order to investigate how the growth of galactic bulges progresses with
  the growth of central black holes (BHs), we observed molecular gas (fuel for the
  coming star formation) in possibly young active galaxies: narrow-line Seyfert 1
  galaxies (NLS1s). We present the results of radio observations of 12CO(1-->0) using
  the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (with 2-4 kpc spatial resolution) for two FIR-bright
  NLS1s, yielding the first detection of their CO emission. Corresponding molecular
  gas masses M(H2) of (1-3)×109 Msolar are the second and fourth largest among NLS1s.
  By estimating dynamical masses and bulge masses Mbulge for these two NLS1s using
  CO channel maps and CO line widths, we found that M(H2) amounted to 13%-35% of these
  masses. Taking into account the star formation efficiency (~0.1), the increase in
  Mbulge in those NLS1s in the near future (<~107.5 yr) is not expected to be a huge
  fraction (1%-5% of the preexisting stars). Bulge growth may have finished before
  BH growth, or bulge-BH coevolution may proceed with many occasionally discrete events,
  where one coevolution event produces only a small amount of mass growth of BHs and
  bulges. We also discuss the ratios of star formation rate to gas accretion rate
  onto BHs, finding that two NLS1s have very small ratios (~1) compared with the Mbulge/MBH
  ratios found in active and inactive galaxies (~700). This huge difference suggests
  either nonoverlapped coevolution, a long star formation duration, or a temporarily
  high accretion rate during the NLS1 phase.'
