abstract: We study the formation histories and present-day structure of galactic subsystems
  formed in a high resolution hydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-sized galaxy.
  The simulated satellites span nearly 4 orders of magnitude in luminosity but have
  a very similar mass within their inner 600 pc with very little scatter. This is
  in agreement with the recent measurements for dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs).
  Interestingly, subhaloes with circular velocity around 20 km/s sometimes host satellites
  that are as bright as the classical satellites and sometimes they are found as completely
  dark objects. We find that there is a critical circular velocity at the epoch of
  reionization, below which haloes fail to host star formation and found as ``dark
  satellites'' today.
