abstract: Formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) on astrophysical mass scales
  is a natural consequence of inflationary cosmology, if the primordial perturbation
  spectrum has a large and negative running of the spectral index as observationally
  suggested today because double inflation is required to explain it and fluctuations
  on some astrophysical scales are enhanced in the field-oscillation regime in between.
  It is argued that PBHs thus produced can serve as intermediate-mass black holes
  (IMBHs), which act as the observed ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) by choosing
  appropriate values of the model parameters in their natural ranges. Our scenario
  can be observationally tested in near future because the mass of PBHs is uniquely
  determined once we specify the values of the amplitude of the curvature perturbation,
  spectral index and its running on large scales.
