abstract: We investigate how cluster morphology is affected by the cosmological constant
  in low-density universes. Using high-resolution cosmological N-body/smoothed particle
  hydrodynamics simulations of flat cold dark matter (LambdaCDM Omega0=0.3,lambda0=0.7)
  and open cold dark matter (OCDM; Omega0=0.3,lambda0=0) universes, we calculate statistical
  indicators to quantify the irregularity of the cluster morphologies. We study axial
  ratios, center shifts, cluster clumpiness, and multipole-moment power ratios as
  indicators for the simulated clusters at z=0 and 0.5. Some of these indicators are
  calculated for both the X-ray surface brightness and projected mass distributions.
  In LambdaCDM all these indicators tend to be larger than those in OCDM at z=0. This
  result is consistent with the analytical prediction of Richstone, Loeb, & Turner,
  that is, clusters in LambdaCDM are formed later than in OCDM and have more substructure
  at z=0. We perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on each indicator for these two models.
  We then find that the results for the multipole-moment power ratios and the center
  shifts for the X-ray surface brightness are under the significance level (5%). Our
  results also show that these two cosmological models can be distinguished more clearly
  at z=0 than at z=0.5 by these indicators.
