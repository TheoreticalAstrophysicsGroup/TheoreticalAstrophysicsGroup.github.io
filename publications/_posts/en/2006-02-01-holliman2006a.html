abstract: This paper describes our experience making a short stereoscopic movie visualizing
  the development of structure in the universe during the 13.7 billion years from
  the Big Bang to the present day. Aimed at a general audience for the Royal Society's
  2005 Summer Science Exhibition, the movie illustrates how the latest cosmological
  theories based on dark matter and dark energy are capable of producing structures
  as complex as spiral galaxies and allows the viewer to directly compare observations
  from the real universe with theoretical results. 3D is an inherent feature of the
  cosmology data sets and stereoscopic visualization provides a natural way to present
  the images to the viewer, in addition to allowing researchers to visualize these
  vast, complex data sets. The presentation of the movie used passive, linearly polarized
  projection onto a 2m wide screen but it was also required to playback on a Sharp
  RD3D display and in anaglyph projection at venues without dedicated stereoscopic
  display equipment. Additionally lenticular prints were made from key images in the
  movie. We discuss the following technical challenges during the stereoscopic production
  process; 1) Controlling the depth presentation, 2) Editing the stereoscopic sequences,
  3) Generating compressed movies in display specific formats. We conclude that the
  generation of high quality stereoscopic movie content using desktop tools and equipment
  is feasible. This does require careful quality control and manual intervention but
  we believe these overheads are worthwhile when presenting inherently 3D data as
  the result is significantly increased impact and better understanding of complex
  3D scenes.
