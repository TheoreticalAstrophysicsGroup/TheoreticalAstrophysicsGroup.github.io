abstract: Massive tori with ~108-109 Msolar are predicted to extend on a ~100 pc scale
  around the center of elliptical galaxy progenitors by a model of a supermassive
  black hole (SMBH) growth coeval to the spheroidal population of the host galaxy.
  Direct detection of such massive tori would cast light on a key physical condition
  that allows the rapid growth of SMBHs and the appearance of QSOs at high redshift.
  For this reason, we examine the detectability of such structures at substantial
  redshift with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). We propose that submillimeter
  galaxies (SMGs) are the best targets to test our predictions. In order to assess
  the observational feasibility, we estimate the expected number counts of SMGs with
  massive tori and check the detectability with the ALMA instrument, the unique facility
  which can resolve the central region of high-redshift objects. Our work shows that
  ALMA will be able to resolve and detect high-J (J>4) CO emissions from ~100 pc scale
  extended massive tori up to z~2. Observations of lensed SMGs will yield excellent
  spatial resolution, allowing us to resolve their massive tori at even higher redshift.
  We further discuss the detectability of the HCN molecule as a better tracer of the
  high-density gas expected in such tori. The final goal of these kind of observations
  is to pinpoint possible physical mechanisms for storing very large amounts of gas
  in the very central galactic regions on timescales of several 108 yr.
