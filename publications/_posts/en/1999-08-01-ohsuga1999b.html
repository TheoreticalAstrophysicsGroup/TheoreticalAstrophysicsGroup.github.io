abstract: By considering the radiative force by a circumnuclear starburst as well
  as an active galactic nucleus (AGN), we analyze the equilibrium configuration and
  the stability of dusty gas in the circumnuclear regions. It is found that the radiative
  force by an intensive starburst can support a stable gaseous wall with a scale height
  of several hundred parsecs. Moreover, by taking the simple stellar evolution in
  the starburst into account, we find that the covering factor of the wall decreases
  on a timescale of several times 107 yr. The large-scale wall, if formed, works to
  obscure the nucleus as a result of the dust opacity. Hence, it is anticipated that
  the index of AGN type tends to shift from higher to lower in several times 107 yr
  as the circumnuclear starburst becomes dimmer. On the other hand, if the AGN itself
  is brighter than the circumnuclear starburst (e.g., the quasar case), no stable
  large-scale wall forms. In that case, the AGN is most probably identified as type
  1. The present mechanism may provide a physical explanation for the putative correlation
  between AGN type and host properties whereby Seyfert type 2 galaxies are more frequently
  associated with circumnuclear starbursts than type 1 galaxies, whereas quasars are
  mostly observed as type 1 regardless of star-forming activity in the host galaxies.
