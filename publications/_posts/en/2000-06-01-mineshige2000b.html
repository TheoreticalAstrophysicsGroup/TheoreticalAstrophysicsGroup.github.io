abstract: 'Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) exhibit an extreme soft X-ray excess
  and large variability. We argue that both features can be basically accounted for
  by the slim-disk model. We assume that a central black-hole mass in NLS1 is relatively
  small, M ~ 105-7MO , and that a disk shines nearly at the Eddington luminosity,
  L_E. Then, the disk becomes a slim disk and exhibits the following distinctive signatures:
  (1) The disk luminosity (particularly of X-rays) is insensitive to the mass-flow
  rates, dot M, since the generated energy is partly carried away to the black hole
  by trapped photons in accretion flow. (2) The spectra are multi-color blackbody.
  The maximum blackbody temperature is T_bb =~ 0.2(M/105 MO )-1/4 keV, and the size
  of the blackbody emitting region is small, r_bb <~ 3 r_S (with r_S being Schwarzschild
  radius), even for a Schwarzschild black hole. (3) All of the ASCA observation data
  of NLS1s fall onto the region of dot M/(L_E/c2)>10 (with L_E being the Eddington
  luminosity) on the (r_bb,T_bb) plane, supporting our view that a slim disk emits
  soft X-rays at ~ L_E in NLS1s. (4) Magnetic energy can be amplified, at most, up
  to the equipartition value with the trapped radiation energy, which greatly exceeds
  the radiation energy emitted from the disk. Hence, energy release by consecutive
  magnetic reconnection will give rise to substantial variability in soft X-ray emission.'
