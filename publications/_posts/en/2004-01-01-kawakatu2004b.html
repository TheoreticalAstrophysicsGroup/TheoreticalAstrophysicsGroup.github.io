abstract: Based on the radiation hydrodynamic model for the black hole(BH) growth
  and incorporating the chemical evolution of the early-type host galaxy, we construct
  the coevolution model of the quasar(QSO)BH and the host galaxy.  As a result, it
  is found that after a galactic wind epoch, the luminosity is shifted from the host-dominant
  phase to the active galactic nucleus-dominant phase(QSO phase) in the timescale
  of a few 108yr.  The former phase corresponds to the early stage of a growing BH
  and can be regarded as a ``proto-QSO'' phase.  Also, by considering theoretical
  predictions for the observable properties in proto-QSO phase, we conclude that radio
  galaxies at high redshifts are a possible candidate for proto-QSOs.
