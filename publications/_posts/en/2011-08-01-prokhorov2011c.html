abstract: The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (hereinafter SZ) effect is a promising tool to derive
  the gas temperature of galaxy clusters. Approximation of a spherically symmetric
  gas distribution is usually used to determine the temperature structure of galaxy
  clusters, but this approximation cannot properly describe merging galaxy clusters.
  The methods used so far, which do not assume the spherically symmetric distribution,
  permit us to derive 2D temperature maps of merging galaxy clusters. In this paper,
  we propose a method to derive the standard temperature deviation and temperature
  variance along the line of sight, which permits us to analyse the 3D temperature
  structure of galaxy clusters by means of the thermal SZ effect. We also propose
  a method to reveal merger shock waves in galaxy clusters by analysing the presence
  of temperature inhomogeneities along the line of sight.
