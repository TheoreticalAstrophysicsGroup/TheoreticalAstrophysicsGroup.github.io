abstract: 'We use very large cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations
  to study the properties of high-redshift Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs). We identify
  star-forming galaxies at z= 3.1 in a cosmological volume of 100 h-1 Mpc on a side.
  We develop a phenomenological model of absorption, scattering and escape of Lyman
  alpha photons on the assumption that the clumpiness of the interstellar medium in
  a galaxy is correlated with the larger scale substructure richness. The radiative
  transfer effect proposed by Neufeld allows a large fraction of Lyman alpha photons
  to escape from a clumpy galaxy even if it contains a substantial amount of dust.
  Our model reproduces, for the first time, all of the following observed properties
  of LAEs at z= 3.1: the angular correlation function, ultraviolet (UV) and Lyman
  alpha luminosity functions and the equivalent width distribution. A simple model
  that takes only dust absorption into account fails in reproducing LAEs that are
  also bright in UV, suggesting that the kind of effect we consider is needed. Our
  model predicts a bimodal age distribution for LAEs. Most of the galaxies with large
  Lyman alpha equivalent widths are young, whereas there are also old, massive and
  dusty LAEs, similar to recently found high-redshift LAEs. The large LAEs have escape
  fractions of Lyman alpha photons of fesc˜ 0.05-0.1.'
