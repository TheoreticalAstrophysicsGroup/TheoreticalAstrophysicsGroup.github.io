abstract: We present two types of numerical prescriptions that accelerate the radiative
  transfer calculation around point sources within a three-dimensional Cartesian grid
  by using the oct-tree structure for the distribution of radiation sources. In one
  prescription, distant radiation sources are grouped as a bright extended source
  when the group's angular size, thetas, is smaller than a critical value, thetacrit,
  and radiative transfer is solved on supermeshes whose angular size is similar to
  that of the group of sources. The supermesh structure is constructed by coarse-graining
  the mesh structure. With this method, the computational time scales with Nmlog (Nm)log
  (Ns), where Nm and Ns are the number of meshes and that of radiation sources, respectively.
  While this method is very efficient, it inevitably overestimates the optical depth
  when a group of sources acts as an extended powerful radiation source and affects
  distant meshes. In the other prescription, a distant group of sources is treated
  as a bright point source ignoring the spatial extent of the group, and the radiative
  transfer is solved on the meshes rather than the supermeshes. This prescription
  is simply a grid-based version of START by Hasegawa & Umemura and yields better
  results in general with slightly more computational cost [?] than the supermesh
  prescription. Our methods can easily be implemented to any grid-based hydrodynamic
  codes and are well suited to adaptive mesh refinement methods.
