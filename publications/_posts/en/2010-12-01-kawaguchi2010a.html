abstract: A sublimation process governs the innermost region of the dusty torus of
  active galactic nuclei. However, the observed inner radius of the torus is systematically
  smaller than the expected radius by a factor of ~1/3. We show that the anisotropy
  of the emission from accretion disks resolves this conflict naturally and quantitatively.
  An accretion disk emits lesser radiation in the direction closer to its equatorial
  plane (i.e., to the torus). We find that the anisotropy makes the torus inner region
  closer to the central black hole and concave. Moreover, the innermost edge of the
  torus may connect with the outermost edge of the disk continuously. Considering
  the anisotropic emission of each clump in the torus, we calculate the near-infrared
  flux variation in response to a UV flash. For an observer at the polar angle thetaobs
  = 25$\,^{i̧rc}$, the centroid of the time delay is found to be 37% of the delay
  expected in the case of isotropic illumination, which explains the observed systematic
  deviation.
