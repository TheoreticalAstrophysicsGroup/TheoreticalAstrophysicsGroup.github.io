<p>The Galaxy-IGM Workshop will be held again this year.</p>

<p>For the past 10 years, the Galaxy-IGM Workshop has been held to share and discuss research results from galaxy observation / theory, IGM observation / theory, and AGN observation / theory, and to develop new collaborative research projects. This workshop has fostered many a student and postdoc to continue to become first-class researchers and teachers. </p> 

<p>This year we have decided to hold a hybrid in-person + online workshop. We shall take sufficient measures to ensure that the meeting can be held safely on site. The program includes, in addition to invited and contributed talks, group work by graduate students and postdocs, a format that was successfully employed in the past three years. We look forward to your participation. </p>

<p>This workshop is supported by the Kenkyukai-kaisai-shien Program of the Center for Computational Science, University of Tsukuba. </p>
