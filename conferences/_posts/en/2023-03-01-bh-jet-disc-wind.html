<p>Despite the fact that the existence of black holes is now firmly established, the structure and physical mechanisms of accretion discs, jets, and disc winds remain unresolved. In order to solve these problems, collaboration between ultra-precise observations by EHT, IXPE, XRISM, etc. and the latest theoretical research is indispensable. Therefore, we will hold a workshop for theoretical and observational researchers to share the latest results and exchange ideas, following the "Black Hole Jet, Accretion Disk, and Disk Wind Workshop 2022" held in January this year. We would like to use this meeting as an opportunity to promote joint research to understand black hole jets, accretion discs, and disc winds in an integrated manner. </p>

<p>This workshop is sponsored by the Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba. It is also supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (PI: Ken Ohsuga, 21H04488), "Driving Mechanism and Diversity of Black Hole Jets Revealed by Ultra-Large Scale Computations and Ultra-High Precision Observations". </p>
