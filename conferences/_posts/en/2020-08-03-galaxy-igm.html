<p>From August 3 to 7 2020, we will hold the "Galaxy-IGM Workshop 2020". </p>

<p>In view of the recent COVID-19 situation, we will hold the event online this year. We will let you know how to connect to the workshop once you have registered. </p>

<p>In this workshop, we will discuss the latest results of theoretical and observational research on "galaxies", "active galactic nuclei", and the "intergalactic medium", and also hold a review lecture and a group study session by students and young postdocs, which was well-received last year. Awards will be given to the groups that performed well in the presentations, so young researchers are encouraged to participate. Please do not hesitate to spread the workd about this workshop to others who may be interested.</p>

<p>This workshop is supported by the Kenkyukai-kaisai-shien Program of the Center for Computational Science, University of Tsukuba. </p>
